JST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Good evening, everyone. My name is Shinzo Abe. I\'m extremely delighted to host tonight\'s banquet here at the State Guest House in honor of the very first visit to Japan by my dear friend, President Trump, and Madam First Lady, Ms. Melania Trump.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYesterday\'s golf diplomacy between Donald and me attracted so much attention, and we actually made everything public, except for the score. And, through golf, we could demonstrate to the world how strong the bond is between Japan and the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut Donald and I are not the first to promote this unique golf diplomacy. Just 60 years ago, my grandfather, Prime Minister Kishi, and President Eisenhower are the ones who initiated this tradition. And after the golf match, President Eisenhower shared two lessons with my grandfather. One, once you become a President of the United States, you need to be at a table with a group of people whom you don\\u2019t like to hang out. Second, when it comes to playing golf, you can play golf only with those who you really, really like to hang out.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut speaking of my relationship with President Trump, that is not enough. If I may add another lesson to the legacy of Prime Minister Kishi and President Eisenhower, I would say it like this: When you play golf with someone not just once, but for two times, the person must be your favorite guy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo, yesterday, we had the pleasure of playing golf together with Mr. Hideki Matsuyama. And, tonight, we are so honored to have the participation of Mr. Isao Aoki, who is a pioneer in Japanese golf. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEven during the time that played golf with President Trump, the President and I were talking about Mr. Aoki. It is all about how his putting that was something that the entire world were mesmerized. And Donald told me as follows: Mr. Aoki\'s putting was just like super, super artistic. But you should never try to do the same, because that is the only thing that Mr. Aoki can only do, and you will not be able to do that. So next time we play golf together, I would love to have Mr. Aoki to join us and enjoy the time that I will spend with Mr. Trump.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSpeaking of the First Ladies, I understand that my wife Akie and Madam First Lady had a chance to try Japanese calligraphy. Each wrote one Chinese character, or kanji: "hei" by Madam First Lady, which means being smooth and calm; and "wa" by my wife Akie, which stands for harmony. And when combined, these two letters literally mean "peace." And I think their wonderful joint work represents our alliance very nicely.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder our alliance, Japan and the United States work hand-in-hand to contribute to regional and global peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor two days, President Trump and I spent many, many hours together, and had an in-depth discussion on various global challenges. And I\'m particularly grateful for President Trump and Madam First Lady, who kindly spent their time with a former abductee and the family members of those who had been abducted by North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it\'s been only one year since I first saw President Trump in New York City. And looking back the over the half-century history of Japan-U.S. alliance, we have never seen two leaders of Japan and the United States forging as close relationship as ours and as strong bond in ours in just one year.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOf course, I\'m very proud of my relationship with President Trump, but we are not the only ones who have supported this invaluable friendship between Japan and the United States. And on this occasion, I would like to acknowledge tremendous efforts by leaders from various fields, including political, business, and cultural leaders who are here today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn honor of such contribution to our invaluable friendship, I invited many distinguished guests who have been making every effort to deepen our friendship. And I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation and also ask for further support for the development of our bilateral relationship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast but not least, let me share with you my honest impression about President Trump\'s visit to Japan this time. As I said, this was the very first visit by President Trump and it was indeed a historic visit. And I do hope that you will enjoy your last night in Tokyo as you wish. And also, I sincerely hope that you will have a really successful trip to Asia this time, which started here in Japan.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo with that, I now would like to propose a toast wishing all the best to President Trump and Madam First Lady, and also wishing for the further development of the friendship between Japan and the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.) (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Prime Minister and Mrs. Abe, this has been a really wonderful two days. We have to spend more time together because I have enjoyed every minute of it, even though he\'s a very, very tough negotiator. And, Melania, a real friend of yours now is Mrs. Abe. And I know you enjoyed it with me. You enjoyed it in Florida and you enjoyed it here, and maybe even more so. But I want to thank you for the royal welcome.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it was really a -- very much a working holiday, even on the golf course. So we can call it a couple of days off, but it wasn\'t. It was full work. Even as we played golf, all we did was talk about different things. (Laughter.) We better not go into it. But I have to tell you, we did, and we made a lot of progress on a lot of fronts.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI do want to congratulate Mr. Aoki. He was one of the great putters -- probably still is. They say you never lose your putting. When you\'re a great putter, you never lose your putting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I remember a specific tournament, believe it or not, because it was one of the best I ever saw. It was the greatest putting display that I ever saw. It was you and Jack Nicklaus. Was that the U.S. Open? The U.S. Open. And you would get up and sink a 30-footer. He\'d get up and sink a 25-footer. And this went on for the whole back nine. And then, ultimately, Jack won by one stroke. I thought it was one of the greatest putting displays anybody has ever seen and there ever was. And I even know your putting stroke -- very flat.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I spoke yesterday with the great Matsuyama, who is doing great, right? He\'s going to be a big star, and he\'s going to be great. I don\'t even know if he\'s with us tonight. I don\'t think he\'s with us tonight. But he does want to get together in New York, and we\'re going to get together. And even though I want to have a great interpreter, but he\'s rapidly learning the language.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I will tell you that it\'s an honor to be with you because everyone in the world of golf talks about that one great afternoon. Just putt after putt, and it was really great. So congratulations. Great gentleman, great gentleman. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo my relationship with Shinzo got off to quite a rocky start because I never ran for office, and here I am. But I never ran, so I wasn\'t very experienced. And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I was now President-elect. But I didn\'t know you were supposed to not see world leaders until after you were in office, which was January 20th. So you were just not supposed to because it was considered bad form. It was not a nice thing to do, and I understand that from the standpoint of the President whose place you were taking.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo you can only take so many calls from world leaders -- because, you know, everybody was calling. But Japan, you take. And some others -- we took Germany, we took Russia, we took China, we took -- we took your Prime Minister.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo it\'s November, and he said to me, "Congratulations on your victory, it was a great victory, I would like to see you. I would like to see you as soon as possible." And I said, "Anytime you want, just come on in, don\'t worry about it." But I was referring to after January 20th. (Laughter.) So I said, don\'t worry about it. Anytime you want, I look forward to seeing you. Just give us a call, no problem, anytime you want. And all of the sudden, I get a call from, actually, Japan press. And they said that our Prime Minister is going to New York to meet with the President-elect.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo the press is going crazy because the Prime Minister of Japan is coming to see me. I think it\'s absolutely fine, but I didn\'t really mean now. I meant some time in February, March, or April. Meaning, you have a very aggressive -- very, very aggressive, strong, tough Prime Minister. That\'s a good thing, by the way -- not a bad thing. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo then the New York media started calling me, and I was getting all sorts of signals from Hope and Sarah, in a different position, and everybody. And they\'re going crazy. They\'re saying, "You cannot see him. It\'s so inappropriate. It looks bad." I say, "What\'s wrong?" They said, "It\'s a bad thing to see him. You have to wait until after, in all fairness, Barack Obama leaves office." And I said, "What do I do?" And they said, "Let\'s call."</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I called him, and he wasn\\u2019t there. He was on the airplane flying to New York. (Laughter.) And I said, "You know what? There\'s no way he\'s going to land and I\'m not seeing him."</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I saw him, and it worked out just fine. Do you agree with that? (Laughter.) And he actually brought me the most beautiful golf club I\'ve ever seen. It was a driver that\'s totally gold. Right? It\'s gold. (Laughter.) And I looked at it -- I said, "If I ever use this driver -- me -- to use that driver at a golf club, I will be laughed off every course I ever go onto." But it is the most beautiful weapon I\'ve ever seen, so I thank you for that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we had a great meeting. It lasted forever. It was a very long meeting in Trump Tower. And for some reason, from that moment on, we had a really -- and developed a really great relationship. And here we are today and better than ever, and we\'re going to work together. And it\'s going to get more and more special, and we\'re going to work out problems of Japan and problems of the United States. And it\'s going to be something very, very special for both countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI just want to finish by saying that Melania and I today visited the palace. This is a beautiful, beautiful place. And we met two very beautiful people, the Imperial Majesties, the Emperor and the Empress, and spent a long time talking to them today. And there was a lot of love in that room for all of you people -- I can tell you -- from everyone from Japan. They love the people of Japan, they love this country dearly, and they have great, great respect for your Prime Minister. And they truly think that your Prime Minister did very, very well when he decided to marry -- or she decided to marry him, Mrs. Abe. But they have great, great respect -- I can tell you that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I just want to conclude by saying that our two great countries will have incredible friendship and incredible success for many centuries to come -- not years, not decades, but for many centuries to come.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd again, it\'s an honor to have you as my good friend, and I just want to thank you and Mrs. Abe. This is a very, very special two days. We will not forget, and we will be back soon. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.)

tomorrow afternoon, only because we have to let the media recover.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 They want to recover.\\xa0 When I said we\'ll do it on Wednesday morning, they all said, will we do it later than that?\\xa0 So I\'m going to do that for the media.\\xa0 So maybe Wednesday afternoon or maybe Thursday morning, whichever is most convenient.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tBut we\'ve had a tremendously successful trip.\\xa0 Tremendous amounts of work was done on trade, not only on the deals -- and we have at least $300 billion worth of deals, but that will be, I think, way triple that number in a fairly short period of time.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tBut I think much more importantly, we\'ve explained that the United States is open for trade, but we want reciprocal trade.\\xa0 We want fair trade for the United States, because with past administrations -- as I said in China and I said very loud and very clear -- the United States has been taken advantage of.\\xa0 They\'re very giving, and they don\'t get in return.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo we want fair trade.\\xa0 We want reciprocal trade.\\xa0 And we\'ll see a lot of great things happen.\\xa0 We\'re also very open -- we\'re open for trade.\\xa0 But we have to be treated fairly.\\xa0 We have to be treated in a reciprocal fashion.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo it\'s been an incredible 12 days.\\xa0 I\'ve enjoyed it immensely.\\xa0 I\'ve made a lot of friends at the highest level, whether it\'s China and the incredible opening they gave us -- that unbelievable evening.\\xa0 People really have never seen anything like it -- going to the Forbidden City and a theater that hadn\'t been open in over 100 years, and the level of talent that we watched.\\xa0 It was really something special.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd then we had great meetings in China.\\xa0 And Japan, likewise -- it was a tremendous rollout.\\xa0 And from the moment we walked off the plane and back on to the plane -- in South Korea, as you know, we made the speech.\\xa0 I believe seldom has there been the opportunity to speak for somebody from the outside world in that hall.\\xa0 So South Korea was terrific to us, and we obviously talked about North Korea.\\xa0 We talked about trade.\\xa0 We talked about lots of different things.\\xa0 But, certainly, in South Korea and Japan, a primary emphasis was on North Korea.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd coming to the Philippines was terrific, and coming to Vietnam was terrific.\\xa0 Vietnam is ordering at least $12 billion worth of Boeings, and I think they were going a different route.\\xa0 But now they\'re going the route of ordering from us.\\xa0 And the reason I like the Boeing is because it\'s jobs for the United States.\\xa0 It\'s not jobs for somebody else.\\xa0 It\'s jobs for the United States.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tVietnam treated us incredibly, as did -- I mean, the Philippines, we just could not have been treated nicer.\\xa0 And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines.\\xa0 The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word.\\xa0 I would say "horrible" is putting it mildly.\\xa0 You know what happened.\\xa0 Many of you were there, and you never got to land.\\xa0 The plane came close but it didn\'t land.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd now we have a very, very strong relationship with the Philippines, which is really important -- less so for trade, in this case, than for military purposes.\\xa0 It is a strategic location -- the most strategic location.\\xa0 And, if you look at it, it\'s called the most prime piece of real estate from a military standpoint.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo it\'s very important that we get along with the Philippines, and we really do.\\xa0 We have a very good relationship.\\xa0 I would actually say probably better than ever before.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo we\'ve accomplished a lot.\\xa0 I\'ve enjoyed it very much.\\xa0 My press -- I feel so sorry for them.\\xa0 They\'re exhausted.\\xa0 Would you like to stop in another couple of countries?\\xa0 Because we can do that if you want.\\xa0 (Laugh.)\\xa0 Otherwise, we\'ll go to the plane and we\'ll take off.\\xa0 But we\'ll be landing in Washington in about 22 hours.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo I appreciate everybody.\\xa0 And I very much appreciate your time.\\xa0 I know how hard you worked also.\\xa0 We all worked hard.\\xa0 But I think the fruits of our labor are going to be incredible, whether it\'s

Oh, Drumstick, I think, is going to be very happy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tpleased to report that, unlike millions of other turkeys at this time of the year, Drumstick has a very, very bright future ahead of him. Drumstick was raised on Carl and Sharlene\\u2019s turkey farm in Douglas County, Minnesota, with the help of five young women from the Douglas County 4-H chapter who are here with us today. And I want to say, great work. Where are they? Please stand. Great job you\'ve done. (Applause.) 4-H. That\'s great. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUpon being pardoned, Drumstick and his friend, Wishbone, will live out their days at \\u201cGobbler\\u2019s Rest\\u201d -- beautiful place. It\'s custom-built; it\'s an enclosure on the campus of Virginia Tech. Tremendous school. There, they\'ll join Tater and Tot, the two turkeys pardoned last year by President Obama.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor. However, I have been informed by the White House Counsel\\u2019s Office that Tater and Tot\\u2019s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked. So we\'re not going to revoke them. So, Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\\u2019d also like to thank the National Turkey Federation for bringing along two other turkeys from Jaindl\\u2019s Turkey Farm in Orefield, Pennsylvania -- the great state of Pennsylvania. We\'re donating these turkeys to Martha\\u2019s Table, a truly fantastic charity right here in Washington D.C., which provides warm meals to people in need. They do a fantastic job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBefore we get to the pardon, I would like to take a moment to extend our very heartfelt special message: Thanks. Thanks, folks -- to the finest and bravest people in the entire world, our great men and women in uniform: the military, law enforcement, first responders. These are incredible people. So, thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMany of you are always -- and you know your loved ones -- and you\'re far away, and you spend so much time away. This Thanksgiving, I want each of you to know that we\'re forever grateful for the incredible job and for the incredible sacrifices that you and your families make in defense of our nation, our freedom, and our truly great American flag.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\\u2019d also like to express my thanks to the wonderful citizens of our country -- the people who care for our communities, raise America\\u2019s children, uphold our laws and our values, and make this amazing land into our national home.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we gather together with our families on Thanksgiving and give thanks for our many blessings, we are reminded of the national family to which we all belong as citizens of this incredible country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis Thursday, as we give thanks for our cherished loved ones, let us also renew our bonds of trust, loyalty, and affection between our fellow citizens as members of a proud national family of Americans.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd now I think Drumstick and Wishbone would be very thankful if we would just get around to the pardon.

ICT</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT QUANG: (As interpreted.) Mr. Donald Trump, President of the United States of America, distinguished American guests, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of the leaders and people of Vietnam, I warmly welcome Mr. President and the high-level American delegation to Hanoi, Vietnam on a state visit at the most vibrant time of bilateral relations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLeaders of the two countries attach great importance to the bilateral comprehensive cooperation. The presence of Mr. President and the distinguished American guests in Hanoi at the invitation of Vietnamese leaders is a testimony to that, as well as to the strong vitality of our relationship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy congratulations to Mr. President on your productive, successful days within the APEC Economics Leaders Week in Da Nang City, with significant contributions to the overall success of the summit. I particularly appreciate Mr. President\'s impressive speech at the APEC CEO Summit with a message reaffirming the strong and long-term commitment of the United States to the Asia Pacific, Indian Ocean, and the nearby region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs an Asia Pacific power, the United States has been and will be playing a very important role to the regional countries, and we want the United States to promote that role in a more active manner.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President has stayed in Da Nang and is now in Hanoi. I believe you and other members of the delegation will better receive the hospitality and friendliness of the Vietnamese people accorded to you and the American people, as well as enjoying the beauty of Hanoi in fall.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President and distinguished American friends, the relationship between Vietnam and the United States has had a longstanding history. In the early years of the previous century, President Ho Chi Minh, a hero of national liberation and a great man of culture, as honored by UNESCO, was on his voyage in search of national salvation. He made a stop in Boston, Massachusetts, a cradle of the American Revolution.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe time he stayed and worked in the U.S. made him believe in the United States and American people as a partner and friends. Right before the establishment of the Vietnam Democratic Republic in August, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh had expressed the desire to meet American friends.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRising above the ups and downs of history, Vietnam and the United States are now friends and comprehensive partners with mutual respect -- respect for independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and respective political system -- making joint efforts for the Asia Pacific of peace, stability, cooperation, and development.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSince the normalization of relations two decades ago, leaders and people of the two countries have shelved the past, overcome differences, built on similarities, looked to the future, and unceasingly forged bilateral friendship and cooperation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith the efforts of the leaders and people of both countries, the momentum of bilateral comprehensive partnership has been well maintained and promoted since the taking office of President Donald Trump. Cooperation has continued to grow, becoming more productive and substantive in a range of areas, such as politics, foreign affairs, economic, trade, healthcare, humanitarian issues, science and technology, exchange of people -- which benefit both sides.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe are happy to note the completion of main components of the Da Nang Airport remediation project.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Donald Trump\'s visit to Vietnam represents an important milestone and the best moment in the history of bilateral relations, opening up a vast future for new pages in the bonds between our nations. I wish to share Mr. President\'s words: No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the regional and international landscape of tremendous changes, I believe the comprehensive, stable, and mutually beneficial relations between Vietnam and the United States will be a positive factor, significantly contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region and the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn this warm and friendly atmosphere, may I invite, Mr. President, American and Vietnamese friends to raise our glasses: To the ever-expanding relations between Vietnam and the United States, to the health of Mr. President, the two countries\' leaders, and to you all present here tonight.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: President Quang, I would like to thank you very much. This is a very, very special time to be with you and the great people of Vietnam. We have come a long way, the United States and Vietnam. We\'ve seen it from both sides of the picture, and this is the pleasant side.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou are doing a spectacular job, your people are doing a spectacular job, and in the United States likewise we are doing very, very well. We\'ve had the highest stock market we\'ve ever had, we had the lowest unemployment in 17 years, and people are pouring back into our country in the form of manufacturers, car builders, and others.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI toured Vietnam today. I was through the streets of Hanoi, and it\'s incredible to see, incredible to watch, and it\'s truly one of the great marvels. It really is something to behold. I would like to congratulate the people of Vietnam; I would like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on an outstanding job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI would also like to send my condolences on Typhoon Damrey, which was devastating and a great loss of life in Vietnam. And please give my regards and our sympathies to everyone. I know you will rebuild, and the families will slowly rebuild. Very tough to recover from that kind of a loss. But please, on behalf of the United States, our condolences.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd at the same time, our congratulations on a job well done. Vietnam has truly become one of the great miracles of the world, and it\'s very impressive. No matter where you come from, no matter who you are, when you look at what\'s happened in Vietnam, there is nothing more impressive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much for this honor, and I look forward to seeing you, Mr. President, many, many times over the future. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t\\xa08:32 P.M.

CST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I told you that we would be saying, merry Christmas again, right? (Applause.) And it\'s great to be back in Missouri -- a sign of a lot of good things because you\'re doing really well.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I want to thank Governor Greitens and Attorney General Hawley, who -- by the way, Josh -- where\'s Josh? Josh, our next senator. Where is he? (Applause.) He\'s going to be a great senator. And he wants to see a major tax cut. I think I can speak for him, right? (Applause.) And your current senator does not want to see a tax cut. That\'s not good. That\'s not good. She wants your taxes to go up.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: Booo --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Secretary Mnuchin, who\'s doing such a fantastic job -- (applause) -- thank you -- and Linda McMahon. Everybody knows Administrator -- small business, became a big business under Linda. She\'s helping a lot of people. Thank you very much, Linda. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI especially want to thank Missouri\'s incredible congressional delegation: Sam Graves -- where\'s Sam? You all here? Yeah. They all flew in with me. They wouldn\'t miss that flight. Vicky Hartzler. Vicky, thank you. Thank you, Vicky.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBilly Long, who I think was my first endorser in the entire country, practically, Billy, right? Thank you, Billy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBlaine Luetkemeyer. Blaine, thank you, Blaine. (Applause.) And he was great on television today. I watched him -- I got up early and I watched you on -- that was a good interview. Thank you. He\'s very much in favor of tax cuts.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJason Smith and Ann Wagner. Thank you, Jason. Thank you, Ann. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, you know, I have two others. I have a lot of faith in Faith, Sally Faith. Where\'s Sally, your mayor? (Applause.) Hi, Sally. Thanks, Sally. And Eric Schmitt, Missouri state treasurer. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, Eric. You\'re doing a great job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJust three months ago, we came to this state to launch our plan to bring back Main Street by cutting taxes for American families and small businesses. Today, I\'ve come back to this incredible state to spend an afternoon with its amazing citizens -- you are amazing -- to help push our plan for historic tax cuts right across that finish line. We\'re going to do that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith your help, we can usher in a thrilling new era of opportunity and growth for this nation that we love so much. Tax cuts have already passed the House of Representatives. (Applause.) Big ones. Big ones. The eyes of the world now turn to the United States Senate.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tA successful vote in the Senate this week will bring us one giant step closer to delivering an incredible victory for the American people. Massive tax cuts and reform. I don\'t even mention the word reform because people don\'t know exactly what we\'re talking about.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know, for years, they have not been able to get tax cuts -- many, many years, since Reagan. And the problem was they talked about tax reform, not tax cuts. I said, don\'t call it "reform," call it "tax cuts and reform." So every once in a while we\'ll add the name "reform." But it\'s tax cuts.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe cannot sit -- (applause.) Right? The Governor agrees.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe cannot sit idly by and watch ourselves losing in competition to other countries as they continue to take away our jobs because their tax codes are more competitive and less burdensome than ours. That\'s why we must cut our taxes, reduce economic burdens, and restore America\'s competitive edge. We\'re going to do that, too. And it\'s already happening. Look what\'s happening with our markets. People get it. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf we do this, then America will win again like never, ever before. (Applause.) A vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again. We want to do that. We want to put America first again. (Applause.) It\'s time to take care of our workers, to protect our communities, and to rebuild our great country. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know, we\'ve spent almost $7 trillion in the Middle East over the last 16 years -- $7 trillion. Now, I\'m taking care of it. We\'re doing numbers like ISIS has never seen before. We\'re wiping them out -- terrorists, they\'re bad. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd all of that, but we\'ve spent almost $7 trillion. We could have rebuilt our country four times over. And we\'re going to start spending here. We\'re going to start spending here. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd with that being said, we\'re going to protect our country, whether it\'s North Korea or any -- but we\'re going to protect our country like never before. We\'re going to build up our military and make our product here and make our planes, and our boats, and our everything here. But we\'re going to build up our military. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we\'ve got to start focusing on our country. That\'s why I\'m saying America first. Make America great again -- you\'ve never heard that expression. (Applause.) All those hats. All those -- they\'ve never heard that expression before.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOh, that was a good expression and it\'s a true expression and it\'s already happening and long ahead of schedule. And in fact, today, some numbers came out that people haven\'t seen in many, many years.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis beautiful city of St. Charles is the perfect place to deliver the message that I want to deliver. It\\u2019s the place where America\\u2019s past and future come to life on its historic brick-lined Main Street. Nice street, do you agree? (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt was along these very streets that, in 1804, the great American explorers, Lewis and Clark, gathered their final supplies before setting out on their very historic expedition of discovery. I have to say, I didn\'t really know that until two days ago. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSee? See, now the world is watching. Look at all the fake news back there. They\'re all --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: Booo --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: They\'re all watching.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, more than two centuries later, a new generation of American pioneers begins its own adventure, gathering inside the startups and the storefronts of main streets across the country, blazing new trails into totally uncharted territory of business and technology, and once again leading our nation into a future of limitless potential.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat\'s what we have in this country. We have the greatest people. It\'s the greatest country. I love this country so much. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur country was not treated properly for a long time. We\'re treating it properly. We\'re treating it with love and with this. You got to treat it with this.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd today, just as it\'s always been, Main Street is the heart of our economy, the soul of our community, and the birthplace of American dreams.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut over the years, crippling taxes, massive regulation, and totally disastrous trade deals -- oh, the trade deals. Oh, I get a headache thinking about who made these deals. (Laughter.) One after another. WTO, NAFTA, the wonderful deal with South Korea -- remember, they said it\'s going to produce 200,000 jobs? And it did, for South Korea. (Laughter.) Didn\'t produce -- we lost 200,000 jobs. It turned some of our businesses\' main streets into empty ghost towns. You see what\'s happened.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to restore American prosperity and reclaim America\'s great destiny. We\'ve already made tremendous progress -- far greater than I would have thought. I will tell you this in a non-braggadocious way -- (laughter) -- there has never been a 10-month President that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you. That I can tell you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, again, the stock market has reached another record, all-time high. (Applause.) The unemployment rate nationwide is the lowest it\'s been in 17 years -- (applause) -- and 13 states this year have seen unemployment drop to the lowest levels in the history of their state. And I hate to tell you, but Missouri happens to be one of them. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ve created nearly 2 million jobs -- 2 million jobs, think of that. We used to lose millions. Now we\'ve created 2 million jobs since I won the election. And, I want to say, since you won the election. I didn\'t win the election; you won the election. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we will create countless more if we can sustain the 3 percent growth rate we have achieved for the past two quarters. But we\'re going to do much better than that. Remember I used to say, we can hit 4 and we can hit 3? And they were all saying, forget it, forget it. It was 1.2. It was doing terribly. We were flat. We were even. In all fairness, the stock market was going this way.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd now, we\'re hitting numbers that nobody thought possible, certainly not in this time. And the numbers going up are going to be much better than anybody anticipates. In fact, they\'re going to say that Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator -- the exact opposite. (Laughter and applause.) They\'re going to start saying, Governor, that he ought to be a little bit more optimistic because his predictions were low, can you believe it?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know, a year and a half ago, they were saying, oh, he can\'t do that. Now they\'re saying, hm, that was quick. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut by the way, the Commerce Department announced this morning that our GDP -- that\'s the big one -- in the third quarter, grew even faster than they reported previously. They made a mistake, they were too low. They had it at 3 percent. By the way, 3 percent -- did you ever think you\'d hear that in less than a year?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: No!</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: And now it comes in at 3.3 percent, which is the largest increase in many years. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd if we didn\'t have the hurricanes, we would have been at 4 percent. The hurricanes were devastating. And I said, they\'re worth a point. They said they were worth like .006, but I said they were worth a point. We would have been at 4 percent, maybe even over 4 percent, but we had hurricanes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe took care of them. In Texas and Florida, they did a great, great job -- amazing job, tremendous leadership. And we\'re very proud.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPuerto Rico has been a very tough situation because of the fact that it was in very, very bad shape before the storms ever hit. But they\'re doing well there and it\'s healing and it\'s getting better. And we\'re getting them power, and all of the things that they have to have.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I want to tell you there are a lot of brave people in every state. We have great, great people, and it\'s our number one resource, believe me. Really great. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut in order to achieve this bright and glowing future, the Senate must pass those tax cuts. Bring Main Street roaring back -- and that\'s what\'s going to happen. This was all done without the tax cuts, and I\'m not sure that people even believe the tax cuts. I want to see what happens.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd the big day will be either tomorrow or the next day. I would say do it now. We\'re ready. (Laughter.) I said to the Republicans -- and I want to tell you, these are good people. They really want a -- I know they get hit hard, the senators and the congressmen -- but they\'re all working hard. It\'s not so easy. It\'s complicated stuff. It\'s not so easy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we had an incredible session yesterday. And I think we\'re there. That\'s why I said, let\'s do -- can we do the vote today? What do I know? I\'m a business guy. Can we do the vote now? Well, they said, how about Friday? I said, I don\'t want to wait until Friday. (Laughter.) Right, Billy? I said, Billy, can we do the vote? Get me the vote.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWell, Billy has already passed it, so -- and then what happens, if it passes it goes into this beautiful committee -- this beautiful -- I call it a pot. And we mix it up, and we stir it up, and we bring all the best things out, and you\'re going to have something, I predict, that will be really, really special.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo, right now -- (applause) -- really is.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo right now, America\'s tax code is a total dysfunctional mess. The current system has cost our nation millions of American jobs, trillions and trillions of dollars, and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance. It is riddled with loopholes that let some special interests -- including myself, in all fairness. This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing -- believe me.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBelieve me, this is not good for me. (Laughter.) Me, it\'s not so -- I have some very wealthy friends -- not so happy with me, but that\'s okay. You know, I keep hearing Schumer, "This is for the wealthy." Well, if it is, my friends don\'t know about it. (Laughter.) I have to explain why.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow it is great for companies, because companies are going to bring back jobs. And we\'re lowering the rates very substantially. But right now, we\'re bringing the rates down from 35 percent -- which is totally non-competitive. The highest industrialized nation in the world, by far, and we\'re bringing it all the way down to 20 percent. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut that\'s good for everybody in the room, whether you have company or whether you want a job, because we\'re going to bring back jobs. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd what we\'ve had is a massive giveaway to foreign countries, which encourage businesses to relocate offshore. And you\'ve seen what\'s happened.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBefore this -- this is, really, I\'m most proud, because, as bad as our tax code is, we have Toyota, we have big car companies coming back in, building plants in Michigan and other places. We have a lot of businesses coming back in, and they see what\'s happening. They see what\'s going on.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat\'s why they\'re doing -- our current code is a giant -- and really it is -- it\'s a self-inflicted economic wound. It\'s been that way for so many years and nobody wanted to do anything about it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut all that will change and it will change immediately if Congress sends a tax cut and reform bill. The biggest tax cut in the history of our country -- bigger than Reagan. If they send it to my desk, I promise all of the people in this room -- my friends, so many friends in this room. It\\u2019s a great state. I promise you I will sign it. I promise. I will not veto that bill. There will be no veto. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder the plan moving forward in the Senate, a typical family of four earning $75,000, as an example, will see their taxes go down by as much as $2,000. That\'s a lot. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, we\'re doing that not just to help people. We\'re doing that because it helps our country. You\'re going to take that $2,000 and maybe you\\u2019ll save some, and you\'re going to spend some. And we\'re going to make product back in our country again. It\\u2019s going to be made here -- going to be made elsewhere. But it\\u2019s going to be made here. We\'re opening up plants. We\'re opening up factories, and we\'re going to be great to small business. Wait until you see the final product. Wait until you see what finally comes out in what I call the mixer.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe beating heart of our plan is a tax cut for working families. That\'s what it is. We\'re going to make sure -- (applause) -- that you keep more of your hard-earned money. We\'re going to make sure, also, that you have a job that you want. You\'re going to have choice. In education we now have choice. Good word. Here you\'re going to have a choice. You\'re not just going to have one -- you\'re going to have a choice of many jobs. People are moving back into our country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder our plan, the first $12,000 of income earned by a single individual will be totally income-tax-free -- zero. (Applause.) And a married couple won\\u2019t pay one dime of income tax on their first $24,000 of income -- zero. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur plan will significantly increase the child tax credit and make it available to more middle-class families because the single most important investment our nation can make is in our children. Do we agree? You agree? You better agree. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFamilies will also benefit from a new credit for other dependents like a child in college, or an elderly loved one. We have our mothers, our fathers. You have your grandparents. You have people that are elderly that have done a fantastic job. They\'ve grown old. You want to help them. Now we are going to help you help them. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage of by the wealthy. Who are they? I don\'t know. (Laughter.) I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It\\u2019s all right. Hey, look, I\\u2019m President. (Laughter.) I don\'t care. I don\'t care anymore. I don\'t care. (Laughter and applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSome of my wealthy friends care. Me? I don\'t care. This is a higher calling. Do we agree? (Applause.) As Hillary said, what difference does it make? It made a difference. It made a big difference. It made a big, big difference. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe want a tax code that is simple and fair, and that\'s for all Americans. The plan that senators will be voting on this week -- hopefully as soon as possible -- closes the loopholes that corporations use to shift their profits to tax havens, and it eliminates deductions for CEO salaries over $1 million. You see what some of these people are making -- a little ridiculous. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\\u2019m driving up their stock. They\'re making a fortune. Then they go to their board, and they tell everybody what a great job they\'re doing. But what am I going to do? (Laughter.) And many of them, honestly, I don\'t like. (Laughter.) Oh, some of these bankers I don\'t like them, and they\'re making a fortune, and it\\u2019s one of those things.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSteve knows a couple of them that I\\u2019m talking about, doesn\'t he? (Laughter.) They say what a great job they do. Right now anybody could do their job because we\'re making it easy for them because we\'re giving them a great and strong economy. And because we\'ve cut regulations more than any President in the history of this country by far, and that\'s for full terms. That\'s not for 10 months. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it allows builders to build, and it allows farmers to farm. You know what I\\u2019ve done for farmers. (Applause.) Where if you had a little puddle in the middle of your field, you go to jail if you touch it, right? You know what I\\u2019m talking about. Not anymore. Not anymore. Not anymore. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it allows bankers to lend. It allows bankers to lend again. So many people came up to me, and they said, we had a 20-year relationship with a bank. We never had a default. We never had a bad loan. Now we go back to the bank, and they say, we can\'t do business with you anymore.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBecause they don\'t qualify, even though they\'re better than the people that do qualify. It\'s incredible. But we\'re back to the strong days of our banks. And not the days of trouble -- pre-that -- we\'re back to the -- where bankers can make loans and community bankers can make great loans to good people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou saw what happened recently where the certain agency or bureau that was causing so much trouble to lenders, where they could not lend. They just couldn\'t lend. It was devastating. They were going out of business. Well, we\'re taking care of that. We\'ve already taken care of a big part of it, and yesterday you saw we won the lawsuit. So that\'s going to be taken care of automatically. (Applause.) Got to get back to business.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and machine shops of America -- the plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe fitters -- the people that like me best. (Laughter.) Actually, the rich people actually don\'t like me, which is sort of interesting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd that\'s fine. You know what? I like that trade. (Laughter.) But really, the people that like me best are those people -- the workers. They\'re the people I understand the best. Those are the people I grew up with. Those are the people I worked on construction sites with. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAll of the people who give their best each and every day to take care of their family and the country that they love -- these are incredible people. They came out to vote for me. They came out to vote for us. People that worked hard, two jobs, three jobs, that hadn\'t voted in many years because they never had anybody they wanted to vote for.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd they came out -- I\'ll never forget, in Tennessee, a great congressman told me -- they had early voting -- said, I\'ll tell you what, we just went through four days of early voting. At that time, it was Mr. Trump. Now they say, Mr. President. But it was Mr. Trump.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHe said, and if the other parts of the country are like what\'s happening in Tennessee -- people are coming from all over Tennessee. They haven\'t voted in years, and now they\'ve got Trump shirts and they\'ve got Trump hats, and they\'ve got Trump-Pence, and they\'ve got everything Trump and Trump-Pence.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd he said, I\'ve never seen anything like it, and I\'ve been a politician for a lot of years. And if it\'s anything like Tennessee, you\'re going to have one hell of a victory. It turned out to be a lot like Tennessee, so -- (applause). And it turned out to be a lot like Missouri. That I can tell you. (Applause.) Because we had a big one here.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I promised Josh that, when he gets it going -- and he\'s got it in very good shape, from what I hear, he\'s a popular -- everybody said, Josh, got to be Josh. Everyone who saw me -- I said, who\'s going to run against her? Josh, Josh. I said, Josh, when you\'re ready, you have my word, I\'m going to come here and campaign with you. We got to get you in. Okay? (Applause.) Got to get you in.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s not enough for the middle class to keep getting by; we want them to start getting way ahead. (Applause.) We\'re going to have them start getting way ahead.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder our plan, middle-class families will not only see their tax bill go down, they will see their incomes go up by an average of around $4,000. (Applause.) And that\'s because we\'re going to cut taxes on American businesses so they will compete for workers, they\'ll raise salaries. The business is going to be happy and the workers are going to be happy and the country is going to be a happy place.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlthough, we\'re going to have very strong borders. Please remember that, okay? Please remember. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE MEMBER: Build the wall.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: We\'re going to have the wall. Don\'t worry about it, we\'re going to have the wall. (Applause.) We don\'t forget that wall. A lot of people say, now that he got elected, is he going to build the wall? The answer is, absolutely -- more so, I think more so. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s not easy dealing with the Democrats. They want to have people pour into our country -- illegals. They don\'t care where the hell they come from. They want to have them pour into our country, they want to raise your taxes, they don\'t want to take care of your military, and all they\'re good at, frankly, is obstructing. They want to obstruct.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut you know what? They may obstruct, but we have gotten through all of the obstruction so far. We\'ll keep it going, believe me. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, America has one of the least competitive tax rates on planet Earth -- 60 percent. Think of that: 60 percent higher than the average in the developed world. So our taxes are 60 percent higher.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn my recent trip to Asia, every single one of the countries I visited, even those with communist governments, have slashed its corporate tax rates and slashed them dramatically. And it\'s very tough competition anyway. But when their taxes are a lot lower, it really makes it very tough.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd that trip was a tremendous success. You know, we brought back $250 billion in contracts. That\'s going to be over a trillion dollars very soon. (Applause.) That\'s a good week and a half\'s work. Boeing came back with contracts. So many of our companies came back, and I\'m very proud of them. And we\'re doing great.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut at the same time, we\'re going to fix trade because trade is unfair. We\'re getting killed on trade. So we\'re going to fix our trade. Unless anybody would like to continue with this horrible situation that we have.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: Booo --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Our plan gets America from the back of the pack and it\'ll bring us right to number one, where we were for years but where we haven\'t been for decades. We\'re going to be right back at number one. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we\'re going to work on trade, but we\'re also going to work on military. When we defend nations that are very wealthy, and we do it for almost nothing, I say, why are we defending them? We love them. I won\'t mention names, but there are a lot of them. We love them. They\'re wealthy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOne of them has a cash flow that they say is unsustainable, it\'s so large. Think of that. How would you like to have an unsustainable cash flow? They don\'t know what to do with their money. And we defend them. It\'s going to change, folks. We\'re going to defend them, but they\'re going to treat us fairly. And they\'re going to pay for their defense. Does that make sense? (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd a lot of this is from many, many years ago, when we defended a defeated country and then they became strong and they became rich and we just kept the same defense. What happened? Why didn\'t anybody go in and negotiate?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd when I was in Asia, I spoke to a couple of the countries about it, and they looked like this. Do you know what this is? (Laughter.) That means they know they\'re getting away with murder and they got to start helping us out, okay? So if you don\'t mind, I\'ll start bringing that up with some of our good friends. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re going to lower our tax rate to the very competitive number of 20 percent, as I said. And we\'re going to create jobs and factories will be pouring into this country, and they already are starting. A lot of people think it\'s going to happen. I don\'t want to say anything. I\'m not going to talk about it. I thought we had healthcare, and we will have healthcare. It\'s going to happen. As soon as we get the taxes, we work on the healthcare, we\'re going to happen. Because we thought we had the votes and something happened a little strange -- (laughter) -- that\'s okay.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen you lose by one vote, then it\'s called -- you go back. You know, some people said, oh, you failed with healthcare. I said, what do you mean we failed? We didn\'t fail. And by the way, what happened -- what happened is Obama took a long time -- years -- to get Obamacare, right? Again, ten months? We\'ve had two runs at it. We\'re coming closer, closer. I think now we have a plan that\'s going to be great. But we\'re not talking about it until after taxes. And then we take care of healthcare.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThen we will have done tax cuts, the biggest in history; healthcare, phenomenal healthcare. I know you don\'t want this -- welfare reform. Does anybody want welfare reform? (Applause.) And infrastructure. But welfare reform -- I see it and I\'ve talked to people. I know people, they work three jobs and they live next to somebody who doesn\'t work at all. And the person who\'s not working at all and has no intention of working at all is making more money and doing better than the person that\'s working his and her ass off. And it\'s not going to happen. Not going to happen. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we\'re going to go into welfare reform, unless Billy doesn\'t want it. Billy, am I okay in saying that I speak for you? He said, yes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, Billy. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: You got a lot of friends out there, Bill.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWell, we\'ll also cut taxes for the millions of small businesses that file as individuals, and that\'s going to come out of the hopper. (Applause.) It\'s getting there and it\'s going to be better and better. We\'re reducing the tax burden on businesses of all sizes and of every, single kind.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs a candidate, I pledged to fight for American jobs. I think it\'s possibly the number one reason I got elected. And I think we\'ve done a lot better, at this point, than anybody ever even thought possible. Think of that, two million jobs since the election -- two million more jobs in this country since the election. Nobody expected that. Nobody expected that. Excuse me, I didn\'t even expect that. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut you cut those regulations and you give people spirit and incentive. And when you have the highest ratings, in terms of confidence, that the country has had in many, many years -- maybe ever -- things happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe tax cut will mean more companies moving to America, staying in America, and hiring American workers right here. So that\'s so important, right? (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSmall business groups across our nation, retailers, restaurants, manufacturers, grocers, contractors support this plan. We have tremendous support for this plan. Tremendous. Because these massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel -- (laughter) -- Little Rocket Man -- (laughter) -- rocket fuel for the American economy. (Applause.) He is a sick puppy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCassandra Porlier -- where is she? Where is Cassandra? She\\u2019s around here. Hello, Cassandra. I met you back there.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tShe and her mother, Teri -- hi, Teri -- they own a jewelry store on Main Street right here in St. Charles. They make really beautiful handmade jewelry. I got to see some of it. I would have taken it in my previous life. But now if I do, they don\'t like that. (Laughter.) We\'re not allowed to take jewelry, right? But they make it right here in the heartland. It\\u2019s beautiful. Our tax plan will ensure that Cassandra can keep growing her business, keep creating jobs, keep giving back to the community that she loves, and just make her more and more successful.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI assume you like that, right? Good.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRandy Schilling is also here. Where\\u2019s Randy? Randy -- hello, Randy. (Applause.) He\\u2019s the founder of O.P.O. -- that\'s an interesting name. It\\u2019s called O.P.O. Startups and a member to dozens of small businesses in the St. Charles area. He\\u2019s a mentor. He really mentors a lot of the businesses, and he\\u2019s respected.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHe also did a terrific job renovating the old post office on Main Street, something I know something about -- old post offices. Did he do a good job, by the way? I hear. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThey said yes, Randy. If he did a bad job, I\\u2019m going to stop right now and just say, good luck, Randy. (Laughter.) They said you did a good job. I know you did.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRandy knows firsthand how the high tax burden is holding America\\u2019s small businesses back, and our tax cut plan will unleash them to thrive like never before. He understands our plan, which will provide relief from the horrible, crushing, unfair estate tax, also known to many as the death tax. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe want to make it easier for loving families to pass on their life\\u2019s work to their children. Be nice. Be very nice, right? (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat\'s a tough one. The Democrats fight that one I think harder than any other thing that we\'re doing. They fight the death tax. They don\'t want it. They don\'t like it. They don\'t want it. It\\u2019s one of those things. But that is one of the hardest things. I have to be -- I see people right here. They\'re obviously very rich, and they love their children, right, in this group? (Laughter.) They love their children. They\'re very rich. They want to pass on what they have without having to have the kids sell the property, mortgage up half of it. But the biggest problem we have on that one, these Democrats are being brutal. And I call them obstructionists, but they want to stop the estate tax. They want to stop the death tax from being rescinded. But we\'re going to try our best on that one.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur economy will receive another enormous boost as trillions of dollars in wealth that\'s parked overseas will be able to come back to our country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, this one that\'s interesting because for years Republicans and Democrats agreed. You have Apple, and you have these great companies having billions and billions of dollars overseas. Now who doesn\'t want the money to come back?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut to show you the lack of leadership that this country had in the past, the Republicans want it, and the Democrats want it. And nothing ever happened. You could have passed that one easy. In fact, we\'re just throwing it into this bill. I could have had a separate bill on that one -- I think. Don\'t you agree, fellas? I could have had a separate bill on that one and gotten it passed in record time. But I figured I\\u2019d put it here because it is actually popular.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut it used to be $2.5 trillion. You know what that is? Trillion. Money you can\'t bring back in. It\\u2019s prohibitive -- both in complexity and in the amount of tax you have to pay. So nobody brings back in -- $2.5 trillion. But $2.5 [trillion] I\\u2019ve been saying for six years. I think now it\\u2019s $4 trillion to $5 trillion. All that money is coming back into the United States, and it\\u2019s going to be invested in our country, instead of sitting and helping others. We want our own help. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat\'s sort of an easy one. Last year, American multinational companies left more than 70 percent of their foreign profits overseas because the current tax system penalizes them for bringing that money back home. They actually get penalized. Our plan switches to a territorial tax system that encourages companies to return their profits to America -- right here to the United States -- where that money belongs going back to work for you. Territorial. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf we want America to thrive in the 21st century, then we must stop running from the competition. And instead, we must start totally winning and winning and winning again. Remember when I used to say: We\'re going to win so much. We\'re going to win -- that the people of Missouri are going to go to your governor, and they\'re going to say, Governor, please, go see the President. We can\'t stand winning so much. Remember I used to say that? (Laughter.) Right? I used to say it, and that\'s what\\u2019s happening. That\'s what\\u2019s happening. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd then the governor is going to come to that beautiful historic Oval Office. He\\u2019s going to say to me, Mr. President, the people of Missouri cannot stand all this winning. (Laughter.) They don\'t want to win so much. They love the old way where they had lousy job numbers, lousy economic numbers, lousy -- yeah, they loved it. Please, Mr. President, please, not -- and I\\u2019ll say, Governor, I don\'t care what they say in Missouri, we\'re going to keep winning and winning and winning. Remember? (Laughter.) That\'s right. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI used to say that. I had fun with that. But we are winning. We\'re winning again. We\'re winning a lot bigger than anyone ever thought possible for such a short period of time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor too long, our tax code has incentivized companies to leave our country in search of lower tax rates. It happens. Many, many companies --- they\'re going to Ireland. They\'re going all over. They\'re going all over Asia. But they\'re stopping because they now want to take advantage of what\'s happening and what we\'re about to pass, hopefully.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy administration rejects the offshoring model. In other words, let\'s build a factory in another country. Isn\'t that wonderful? That really helps us a lot. Fire everybody, and let\'s build a product, and let\'s send it in, without tax, back into the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat model doesn\'t work for me. It never worked, and it shouldn\'t have worked for any of our other past Presidents, believe me. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur new model is the American model. Call it the Trump model, where we build it here. As much as possible, we build it here. Simply put, our tax plan is anti-offshoring and 100 percent worker, 100 percent worker, 100 percent pro-America. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder the American model, we\'re reducing burdens on our businesses as long as they do business in our country. Okay? They do business here.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, we love Mexico. It\'s a wonderful place. But I don\'t like when our car companies move to Mexico, fire everybody, build the same car in Mexico, send it through our borders with no taxes, no nothing, and we buy the car. Same price. We buy the car.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the meantime, what do we get out of it? We get no tax and we get unemployment all over. That\'s stopping. So now the plants are starting to move back. And now there\'s a price to pay when they do that little number on us. (Applause.) That\'s how we will all succeed and we grow together as one team, one people, as one American family. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis week\\u2019s vote can be the beginning of the next great chapter for the American worker.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTo summarize: Our plan cuts taxes for the working and middle-income families; it nearly doubles the amount of income taxed at the rate of zero; it lowers tax rate; it expands the child tax credit; it provides relief from the estate tax, also known as the death tax; it cuts small business taxes; it reduces the corporate rate from 35 percent all the way down to 20 percent; and it provides a one-time low tax rate to return corporate money parked overseas -- trillions and trillions of dollars.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis is the right plan. This is the right time. We have a moment in time. The Republicans have the Senate. The Republicans have the House. The Republicans have the White House. It\'s very unusual. It\'s very unusual. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis is our chance to free our economy from our workers -- from the terrible tax burdens. We have workers that are so burdened with taxes. We\'re freeing our workers from those terrible burdens.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRepublicans in Congress campaigned on cutting taxes. We also campaigned on repeal and replace. It\'s going to happen. It\'s going to happen. Take your time, it\'s going to happen -- going to happen. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMany Democrats have promised tax cuts that don\'t mean anything because they really want major tax increases. Senator Claire McCaskill -- have you ever heard of her?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: Booo --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: -- is doing you a tremendous disservice. She wants your taxes to go up. She\'s weak on crime, she\'s weak on borders, she\'s weak on illegal immigrations, and she\'s weak on the military. Other than that, I think she\'s doing a fantastic job. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut now comes the moment of truth. In the coming days, the American people will learn which politicians are part of the swamp and which politicians want to drain the swamp. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf you make your voices heard and call up your congressmen -- and they\'ve been terrific -- and call up your senators -- and they have been totally terrific. Most of them have been incredible. They really are. They\'re friends of mine. They\'ve been incredible.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut, it doesn\'t take much. That\'s why we need more. We need to have a larger number. But most of them have been incredible. But call your senators. Call you congressmen, because we have no choice. We have to act. We have to act as a country. This isn\'t good for the Republican Party; this is good for the country and that\'s ultimately what\'s it all about. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo, this week, hopefully, the Senate can join the House and take that strong stand for middle-class families and for business, and for jobs, and for competition, and for bringing money back. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd remember, I was the one -- when I was here last time, I said, we\'re going to have Christmas again. I was the one that said, you go to the department stores and you see "Happy New Years," and you see red, and you see snow, and you see all these things. You don\'t see "Merry Christmas" anymore.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith Trump as your President, we are going to be celebrating Merry Christmas again, and it\'s going to be done with a big, beautiful tax cut. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you everybody. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t3:06 P.M.

EDT</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) I extend my heartfelt welcome to the visit by Your Excellency, President Donald Trump, and Madam First Lady to the Republic of Korea. His visit marks the first state visit by the U.S. President to Korea in 25 years. And President Trump is also the first state guest for myself and my government. This special bond forged between President Trump and myself, I find it very meaningful and I am gratified to be part of it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Trump and I met and communicated with each other numerous times, building deep trust and consolidating our friendship. Today we had candid discussions about steadfastness of ROK-U.S. alliance. Moreover, we agreed to work towards resolving North Korean nuclear issue in a peaceful manner and bringing permanent peace to the Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAgainst escalating nuclear and missile threats from North Korea, we reaffirmed our principle that we must maintain a strong stance toward North Korean threats based on overwhelming superiority of power. President Trump has reaffirmed his ironclad commitment to defend Korea, and President Trump and I agreed to further strengthen the robust combined defense posture of our two countries. In this regard, President Trump and I agreed to expend rotational deployment of U.S. strategic assets in and around Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will step up our collaboration to enhance Korea\'s self-defense capability to unprecedented levels. To this end, we reached a conclusion today to lift the payload limit on Korean missiles completely, with a final agreement. We also agreed to begin consultation for Korea\'s acquisitions and development of Korea\'s state-of-art military reconnaissance assets.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOnce again, we strongly urge North Korea to halt its nuclear and missile provocation, and to come to a dialogue table for denuclearization as soon as possible. President Trump and I reaffirmed our current strategy, which is to maximize pressure and sanctions on North Korea until it gives up nuclear weapons and to come to the table for dialogue on its own.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAt the same time, should North Korea choose to make the right choice, we also reaffirmed our view that we are willing to offer North Korea a bright future. Based on such common approach between our two countries, we will continue to lead efforts to bring peaceful and fundamental solutions to North Korean nuclear issues.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will maintain close collaboration with the international community, including the neighboring countries. I sincerely hope that President Trump\'s visit at this time will be a turning point for the situation on the Korean Peninsula in a stable manner.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, President Trump and I visited Pyeongtaek base, which is a symbolic venue for showing the future of ROK-U.S. alliance and also Korea\'s contribution to the alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we gave our words of encouragement to Korean and American servicemembers while striving to realize our common goal, we could feel the strong friendship of Korea and U.S. alliance on the site. President Trump and I also agreed to continue strengthening of the combined defense postures and capabilities of the bilateral alliance by pursuing defense cost-sharing at an adequate and reasonable level.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast, but not least, we reaffirmed that economic cooperation is an important pillar of ROK-U.S. alliance. We share the view that economic cooperation is a critical element in our efforts to pursue sustainable and future-orientated ROK-U.S. alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn order to enjoy the benefit of free, equitable, and balanced trade together, we agreed to have the relevant authorities expedite the process of KORUS FTA consultation. By sharing the universal value and the fruits of economic prosperity with the humankind, President Trump and I agreed to make a joint contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also agreed to continue strengthening cooperation for global challenges, including issues of terrorism, women, human rights, and public health.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Trump requested that I need to talk with him continuously, and we agreed that we will continuously have frequent and close communications. And by doing that, we\'ll further strengthen the trust and ties between us, and also solidify the bilateral alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOnce again, I extend a warm welcome to President and Madam First Lady\'s visit to Korea. Please enjoy the beautiful autumn weather and find deepening of friendship in our two countries, as well as our two leaders. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, President Moon. Thank you for honoring us with the invitation to be here today and for the incredibly warm welcome and magnificent ceremony you have given us during our first trip to the very beautiful city of Seoul. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMelania and I had a wonderful time having tea with you and First Lady Kim -- thank you -- at the beautiful Blue House, which I\'ve heard so much about, and I\'ll get to visit and see firsthand. We\'re looking forward to joining you for dinner this evening, and we have much to discuss.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, the President and I had an opportunity to talk about a range of vital economic and security matters, including our trade relationship and our joint efforts to solve North Korea\'s grave nuclear threat to South Korea and, indeed, the entire world. This is a worldwide problem.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Republic of Korea is more than a longstanding ally of the United States. We are partners and friends who have fought side-by-side in a war, and, really, worked very hard and prospered toward a great and lasting peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI feel confident that we\'ll be able to reach a free, fair, and reciprocal trade deal as we renegotiate our current five-year-old trade document. We cannot allow North Korea to threaten all that we have built -- and we have built it very much together, and we\'re very, very proud of it, also, together -- but all that we\'ve built in the decade since our soldiers sacrificed side-by-side in the struggle for freedom. Our alliance is more important than ever to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and across the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat is why Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, who is with us today, and Secretary of Defense Mattis, who was here just a short time ago, have all traveled to Seoul in the first year of my administration. It was very important to me that they did.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNorth Korea\'s sixth test of a nuclear device and its missile launches are a threat not only to the people of South Korea but to the people all across our globe. We will together confront North Korea\'s actions and prevent the North Korean dictator from threatening millions of innocent lives. He is indeed threatening millions and millions of lives so needlessly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNorth Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation, including China and Russia, to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs, and live in peace. As the South Korean people know so well, it\'s time to act with urgency and with great determination.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAll nations must implement U.N. Security Council regulations and cease trade and business entirely with North Korea. It is unacceptable that nations would help to arm and finance this increasingly dangerous regime.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we work together to resolve this problem using all available tools short of military action, the United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe crucial U.S. security partnership with South Korea is just one aspect of our enduring alliance. We also share deep partnerships on a range of issues, from cultural exchange to cutting-edge advances in science and medicine, and the very important issue of trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCurrently, we are looking at ways of improving our economic relationship. I would like to thank President Moon for instructing his trade negotiators to work closely with us to quickly pursue a much better deal -- a deal that, frankly, has been quite unsuccessful and not very good for the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the more than six decades since we signed our mutual defense treaty, our alliance has grown stronger and deeper. Our two nations symbolize what independent countries can accomplish when they serve the interests of their people, respect the sovereignty of their neighbors, and uphold the rule of law.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tImagine the amazing possibilities for a Korean Peninsula liberated from the threat of nuclear weapons, where all Koreans could enjoy the blessings of liberty and the prosperity that you have achieved right here in South Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also want to congratulate President Moon and the South Korean people on hosting the Winter Olympics this upcoming February. It will be a truly spectacular event.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President, I want to thank you and First Lady Kim. And, I mean, it was just so special today. The ceremony was so beautiful. We very much thank you for it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether, our two nations will handle threats to peace and security, stand up to those who would threaten our freedom, and boldly seize the incredible opportunities for a better, brighter, and more prosperous tomorrow.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn good times and bad, in moments of great hardship and great success, our two nations can always count on the close bonds and deep friendship we share as free, proud, and independent people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President, I look forward to the rest of our visit together, and I send the wonderful citizens of South Korea the best wishes from the people of the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMODERATOR: Thank you very much. We have just heard from President Trump, and now would like to invite the questions from the members of the media corps.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we would like to now ask the White House correspondents from the U.S. side to ask questions, and President Trump will respond. And then from the Blue House, there will be Q and A.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: The first question from the United States will go to Margaret Brennan from CBS.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Thank you, sir. Mr. President --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Which one? (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ President Trump -- I will have questions from both of you gentlemen. But, President Trump, you spoke here in South Korea saying that you do believe that the crisis with North Korea will be worked out. So, specifically, have you seen any success in your diplomatic strategy so far? And do you still believe that direct talks are a waste of time?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think you know me well enough to know that I don\'t like talking about whether I see success or not in a case such as this. We like to play our cards a little bit close to the vest.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI will say this -- that I believe it makes sense for North Korea to do the right thing, not only for North Korea, but for humanity all over the world. So there is a lot of reason, a lot of good reason behind it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith that, yes, I think we\'re making a lot of progress. I think we\'re showing great strength. I think they understand we have unparalleled strength. There has never been strength like it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know we sent three of the largest aircraft carriers in the world, and they\'re right now positioned. We have a nuclear submarine also positioned. We have many things happening that we hope, we hope -- in fact, I\'ll go a step further, we hope to God we never have to use.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith that being said, I really believe that it makes sense for North Korea to come to the table and to make a deal that\'s good for the people of North Korea and the people of the world. I do see certain movement, yes. But let\'s see what happens.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ And on direct talks, sir?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don\'t want to say that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Okay.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I just don\'t want to say that. You can understand that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ I do, sir.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ And, President Moon, you, in your meeting earlier with President Trump, were spoken about by President Trump when he gestured to the military purchases that your country will be making. And I\'m wondering, as you look towards that military build-up, if that signals something -- perhaps a change in your view -- where you believe a more aggressive stance towards North Korea is more appropriate.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) If I could have the question repeated again. Are you referring to the acquisition of the military assets, or are you referring to the military tensions that could be incurred?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ President Trump said you would be making military purchases of military equipment. What does that signal (inaudible)?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) I\\u2019m not entirely sure which direction your question was, but I can say one thing: When it comes to the state of our reconnaissance assets and the strategy assets -- on acquisition of this U.S. strategy assets, we have agreed to begin the consultations for Korea\'s acquisition of such assets. And that is to enhance Korea\'s defense capabilities and also the combined defense posture of Korea and the United States. I think it is essential.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Margaret, if I may add to that, that the President and I have agreed they\'ll be buying a tremendous -- which they want, and which they need, and everybody thinks it makes a lot of sense.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe make the greatest military equipment in the world, whether it\'s planes, whether it\'s missiles. No matter what it is, we have the greatest military equipment in the world. And South Korea will be ordering billions of dollars of that equipment, which, frankly, for them makes a lot of sense. And for us, it means jobs; it means reducing our trade deficit with South Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut they\'ll be ordering billions of dollars\' worth of equipment, and we\'ve already approved some of those orders. Okay? Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ I have a question for President Moon: Between Korea and the United States, I think one of the most important diplomacy challenges will be to work on -- resolve the nuclear problem of the DPRK. And you gave a foreign press interview -- you talked about bringing balance and diplomacy, and you talked about resolving nuclear problem and the close cooperation between Korea and the United States, and you talked about China\'s role.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAre you referring to the balance between the U.S. -- balance of Korea between U.S. and China, or are you referring to something else? And you have had a third summit meeting at the summit meeting you just had. You said that you have agreed to bring permanent peace to (inaudible) on the Korean Peninsula. And what kind of role are you expecting the United States and President Trump to play with regards to settling peace on the Korean Peninsula?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) So on bringing balance in our diplomatic approaches, this is not about our stance vis-\\xe0-vis the United States and China. We are trying to bring a solution to the DPRK nuclear problem and to bring permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, moreover, we would like to promote peace, stability and prosperity of the Northeast Asian region. So we would like to expand our diplomatic efforts in this regard. And that should include our efforts for China as well as (inaudible) and Russia and the EU.</p>\\n<p>\\n<br/>\\n\\tI believe that we should diversify efforts -- diplomatic efforts -- so that we can pursue a more balanced approach. So that was the intention of making such comment.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd to establish permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula and to resolve the nuclear problem, I think there\'s role to be played by the United States and China. And when it comes to the United States, a very strong sanctions and pressure is being put by the United States. The U.S. is leading efforts, and I am very sure that substantive results will be realized through such efforts.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd China has also faithfully implemented the U.N. resolution to impose sanctions on DPRK. So we have heightened the pressure and sanctions on DPRK, and I think this will also contribute to resolving the nuclear problem.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd if our international society\'s efforts bear fruits and if we can really make a turnaround, then I\'m sure that we will be able to bring North Korea to the table of dialogue. And through such dialogue, I am very confident that we can freeze a nuclear program and ultimately dismantle the weapons of the DPRK entirely. And in this, I believe that cooperation from the U.S. and China is essential.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd on establishing a permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula, I don\'t think it\'s the right timing that we talk about this issue. Now we should focus on bringing an end to the DPRK provocations, and bringing DPRK to the table for dialogue. This is a pending challenge we must address now. So we must focus on sanctions and pressure. And there is a time -- the time finally comes that we should certainly make efforts to further consult each other -- Korea and the U.S. -- for settling peace on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I want to just say that President Xi -- where we will be tomorrow, China -- has been very helpful. We\'ll find out how helpful soon. But he really has been very, very helpful. So China is out trying very hard to solve the problem with North Korea. We hope that Russia, likewise, will be helpful. We also hope that other countries -- and we know for a fact that other countries have already started. And we\'ve had great dialogue with many other countries, as you know, and they\'re really helping a lot.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo if we get China, if we get Russia -- and we have some other countries, but we want to get most of them -- we think that things will happen, and they could happen very quickly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis is a problem, by the way, that should have been done over the last 25 years, not now. This is not the right time to be doing it, but that\'s what I got. That\'s what I got. This is a problem that should have been taken care of a long time ago.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: Thank you. The United States\' second and final question will go to Ali Vitali from NBC.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Thank you, Mr. President. You\'ve talked about wanting to put extreme vetting on people trying to come into the United States, but I wonder if you would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Trying to what?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Buy a gun.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, you\'re bringing up a situation that probably shouldn\\u2019t be discussed too much right now. We could let a little time go by, but it\'s okay. If you feel that that\'s an appropriate question, even though we\'re in the heart of South Korea, I will certainly answer your question.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf you did what you\'re suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago, and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him, and hit him and neutralize him. And I can only say this: If he didn\\u2019t have a gone, instead of having 26 dead, you would have had hundreds more dead. So that\'s the way I feel about it. Not going to help.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ And are you considering any kind of gun control policy going forward because --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I mean, you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation, is Chicago, and Chicago is a disaster. It\'s a total disaster. Just remember, if this man didn\\u2019t have a gun or rifle, you\'d be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ (As interpreted.) For President Trump: Today you visited Pyeongtaek military base as you first stop, and we have allocated 9 trillion won for the building of the military base. And there\'s been bits of conflict, confrontations with the residents of Pyeongtaek over the construction of the Pyeongtaek base. So, to Koreans, a lot of taxpayers\' money has been put into build the Pyeongtaek base and a lot of sacrifices have been made to build that base. So you visited the Pyeongtaek base today and many people talked about freeriding of Korea against security of the United States. So what are your feelings about such talks as you visited the Pyeongtaek base?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd another question I have is that people have concerns about Korea passing, although a lot of that has gone away. People are still concerned that Korea may be neglected in diplomacy. So what are your views on the Korea passing? Can you just say for sure, for certain, that Korea passing no longer exists for the Korean people?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I\'ll start off with your second. South Korea -- Republic of Korea, Korea -- is very important to me. And there will be no skipping South Korea, I can tell you that right now. Plus, I\'ve developed great friendships, not only with the President but with others, and we\'re not going to let them down and they\'re not going to let us down. Because we\'re doing a lot for them, to be honest. We\'re doing a lot for them.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs far as the base is concerned, I thought that Humphreys was an incredible military installation. I know what it costs, and it\'s a lot of money. We actually spent some of that money, and, as you know, that money was spent, for the most part, to protect South Korea, not to protect the United States. But some of that money was spent by us.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat being said, that was long before my time, and I\'m sure I could have built it for a lot less. (Laughter.) That\'s what I do. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) If you don\\u2019t mind, I\'d like to make some supplementary remarks.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, President Trump visited Pyeongtaek military base, and his visit shows -- through his visit, we were able to show that Korea is making significant contribution -- huge contributions to the KORUS alliance. I hope that that has been felt by President Trump. And at the expanded summit talks, he has expressed his appreciation for the construction of the splendid base. And at the Pyeongtaek base, with the 8th Army Commander, as well as the USFK Commander, we had a briefing by the commanders and there was a strong emphasis on their part as well.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t\\xa05:48 P.M.

ICT</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Everybody okay? Everybody happy? Everybody healthy? Two more days -- no problem.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s been a -- I think it\'s been a great trip. In certain ways, it\'s been very epic. I think things have happened that have been really amazing. Prime Minister Abe came up to me just at the end, and he said that since you left South Korea and Japan, that those two countries are now getting along much, much better. That\'s from Prime Minister Abe -- that there\'s been a real bonding between South Korea and Japan. So that was great.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we had a time in China. You were there. Were most of you there? Jennifer?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ We all were, sir.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: They say in the history of people coming to China, there\'s been nothing like that. And I believe it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDid you see the show? Did most of you see the show or part of the show afterwards? It was incredible.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ We saw the opera but not the --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: The opera was great too, but the following night -- that was the first time that theater has been used at the Forbidden City in over a hundred years. You know that. They prepared the theater for that -- the first time in over a hundred years.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNo, it was an amazing -- we have an amazing feeling toward each other. And he\'s for China; I\'m for USA. You know, it\'s one of those things. But we have a great feeling.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo it\'s been really very incredible. And then today was excellent. Today was a different kind of a thing. It\'s a conference.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd then tonight they\'re having a state dinner in Hanoi. And we then go to the Philippines, which was a rough trip the last time. That was a rough presidential trip, but this won\'t be. And we\'re staying the extra day because they have the two conferences; they have first day and they have the second day. And the second day, a lot of people say is very important. And I said, you know what, if I\'m there, I should do it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut it\'s gone really well. I\'ve really enjoyed it. Developed some new friendships -- some really good friendships. But the three countries we\'ve stopped in, the original three are -- they\'re really in our camp, and we\'re in their camp.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ How were your discussions with Vladimir Putin? Did you discuss Syria? And apparently they\'ve issued a joint statement that --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: We issued a joint statement. We\'re going to be -- have you seen the statement yet?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: It\'s going out -- it\'s on the way.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: So I think it\'ll go out. You\'ll see it in a little while.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: It may be out, now that you guys -- now that we\'re in the air.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: It\'s going to save tremendous numbers of lives. And we did that very quickly. We agreed very quickly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs you know, we saw each other last night just for a picture, and that was the first time. And then today we had a roundtable with numerous countries. You have a list of the countries, obviously. Right? You have a list.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we spoke intermittently during that roundtable. We seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship considering we don\'t know each other well. I think it\'s a very good relationship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe had two or three very short conversations because of the meeting, the fact that we\'re at a meeting. But during those conversations, we talked about Syria and de-conflicting, et cetera. You know, we have areas where troops are facing -- our troops -- I mean, their troops are facing our troops and there\'s nothing in between.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we issued a statement -- a joint statement. It was just approved, and I think people are going to be extremely happy with it and also very impressed with it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Did Russia\'s attempts to meddle in U.S. elections come up in the conversation?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: He said he didn\'t meddle. He said he didn\'t meddle. I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. But I just asked him again, and he said he absolutely did not meddle in our election. He did not do what they\'re saying he did. And he said --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Do you believe him?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, look, I can\'t stand there and argue with him. I\'d rather have him get out of Syria, to be honest with you. I\'d rather have him -- you know, work with him on the Ukraine than standing and arguing about whether or not -- because that whole thing was set up by the Democrats.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI mean, they ought to look at Podesta. They ought to look at all of the things that they\'ve done with the phony dossier. Those are the big events. Those are the big events.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut Putin said he did not do what they said he did. And, you know, there are those that say, if he did do it, he wouldn\'t have gotten caught, all right? Which is a very interesting statement. But we have a -- you know, we have a good feeling toward getting things done.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf we had a relationship with Russia, that would be a good thing. In fact, it would be a great thing, not a bad thing. Because he could really help us in North Korea. We have a big problem with North Korea. And China is helping us. And because of the lack of a relationship that we have with Russia because of this artificial thing that\'s happening with this Democratic-inspired thing, we could really be helped a lot, tremendously, with Russia having to do with North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, you know, you\'re talking about millions and millions of lives. This isn\'t baby stuff. This is the real deal. And if Russia helped us, in addition to China, that problem would go away a lot faster.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ How did you bring up the issue of election meddling? Did you ask him a question?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: He just -- every time he sees me, he says, "I didn\'t do that." And I believe -- I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, "I didn\'t do that." I think he\'s very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDon\'t forget, all he said is he never did that, he didn\'t do that. I think he\'s very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Because again, if we had a relationship with Russia, North Korea -- which is our single biggest problem right now -- North Korea, it would be helped a lot. I think I\'m doing very well with respect to China. They\'ve cut off financing; they\'ve cut off bank lines; they\'ve cut off lots of oil and lots of other things, lots of trade. And it\'s having a big impact. But Russia, on the other hand, may be making up the difference. And if they are, that\'s not a good thing.<br/>\\n\\tSo having a relationship with Russia would be a great thing -- not a good thing -- it would be a great thing, especially as it relates to North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I\'ll say this, Hillary had her stupid reset button that she spelled the word wrong, but she doesn\'t have what it takes to have that kind of a relationship where you could call or you could do something and they would pull back from North Korea, or they\'d pull back from Syria, or maybe pull back from Ukraine. I mean, if we could solve the Ukraine problem --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut this is really an artificial barrier that\'s put in front of us for solving problems with Russia, and he says that very strongly. He really seems to be insulted by it, and he says he didn\'t do it. So --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ (Inaudible) do you believe him --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Excuse me?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Even if he (inaudible) one-on-one, do you believe him?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn\'t do it. And then you look, and you look at what\'s going on with Podesta, and you look at what\'s going on with the server from the DNC and why didn\'t the FBI take it, why did they leave it; why did a third party look at the server and not the FBI -- if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what\'s going on here?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd then you hear it\'s 17 agencies. Well, it\'s three. And one is Brennan and one is whatever. I mean, give me a break. They\'re political hacks.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo you look at it -- I mean, you have Brennan, you have Clapper, and you have Comey. Comey is proven now to be a liar and he\'s proven to be a leaker.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo you look at that, and you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that. Now, you\'re not going to get into an argument. You\'re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ You seem to have a fairly warm relationship with a number of --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I do.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ -- totalitarian or authoritarian leaders --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: And others.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ And others. So, Putin, Xi, leader of the Philippines. Do you think you -- what do you think -- do you think you understand them in a certain way or relate to them in a way that other Presidents haven\'t?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I don\\u2019t know. They had a story today in one of the papers about China. China likes me. China likes me. And I get along with them; I get along with others too.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI get along very well with Angela. You people don\'t write that. I actually get along really well with Angela. You know, they had that handshaking event. I was with her for a long time before that. And somebody shouts out, "shake her hand, shake her hand." And I didn\'t hear them. So by not shaking her hand, they said -- I have a great relationship with her. I have a great relationship with Theresa May. I have a great relationship with Justin Trudeau, who I just left.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI think I -- I\'ll be honest with you, I think I have a great relationship with every single one of them. Every person in that room today -- you had what, 15, or so, or 18? Asia Pacific --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Well, 21 including you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Everyone in that room, I have a good relationship. They\'re very different people, but everyone. And I do have a very good relationship with Xi, obviously. It\'s the biggest state -- it\'s the biggest state entrance and the biggest state dinner they\'ve ever had, by far, in China. He called it a state-plus. Like he said it -- he actually said, state-plus-plus, which is very interesting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut he\'s -- you know, look, again, he\'s a strong person. He\'s a very smart person. I like him a lot; he likes me. But, you know, we represent two very different countries. But we get along very well. And that\'s a good thing that we along; that\'s not a bad thing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd on trade, you know, it was -- most of the news covered it fairly. Some didn\'t. When I said it\'s not your fault -- because I was saying how China has been hurting us on trade for many decades, for many years -- and it really is. It\'s not his fault. We should have been doing that. But we didn\'t do it. It\'s the fault of the administrations that preceded me. And we\'re not going to do that anymore; we\'re going to be very tough on trade. And he understands that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ In the past, American presidents have felt the obligation to raise issues about human rights abuses. Do you feel like that\'s an obligation and that\'s something that you feel is important to do?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I do. But I also raise issues on many other things. I mean, I have an obligation -- we lost, last year, with China, depending on the way you do your numbers, because you can do them a numbers of way -- anywhere from $350 [billion] to $504 billion. That\'s with one country. I\\u2019m going to fix that. And I\'ve got to fix what we have with Mexico, who was there today too, who I also have a very good relationship with. And I have a great relationship with France. Some of you were in France with me, with the Eiffel Tower dinner. We have a great relationship with Emmanuel.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I think that\'s the thing. I\'ve actually been getting -- I always said it, I think -- I said, I think one of my strong suits is going to be foreign affairs. And we\'re actually getting very good marks having to do with foreign affairs. There\'s nobody that I can think of that I don\'t have a very good relationship with.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut when we can -- I mean, you\'ll be seeing the release that\'s put out. But we can save many, many, many lives by making a deal with Russia having to do with Syria, and then ultimately getting Syria solved and getting Ukraine solved and doing other things, having a good relationship with Russia is a great, great thing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd this artificial Democratic hit job gets in the way. It gets in the way. And that\'s a shame because people will die because of it. And it\'s a pure hit job. And it\'s artificially induced. And it\'s a shame. But anyway.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ If we could ask you about Roy Moore. Is it time to pitch him overboard?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, again, I\'ve been with you folks, so I haven\'t gotten to see too much. And believe it or not, even when I\'m in Washington and New York, I do not watch much television. I know they like to say -- people that don\'t know me, they like to say I watch television. People with fake sources -- you know, fake reporters, fake sources. But I don\'t get to watch much television, primarily because of documents. I\'m reading documents a lot, and different things.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI actually read much more -- I read you people much more than I watch television. But anyway -- but so I have not seen very much about him, about it. And, you know, I put out a statement yesterday that he\'ll do the right thing, that -- he was interviewed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ But four women have come forward and accused him of inappropriately touching them, basically making advances when they were underage, including a 14-year-old. I mean, at what point -- and you said, "if he did it." But at what point do you decide if he did it? It\'s right now their word against his.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Honestly, I\'d have to look at it and I\'d have to see. Because again, I\\u2019m dealing with the President of China, the President of Russia, I\'m dealing with the folks over here. So I haven\'t devoted -- I haven\'t been able to devote very much time to it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I\'ve been at -- I mean, you people are just as strong as me. You\'re following me all over the place. I mean, we are going to lots of meetings, right? And, by the way, anybody that took the bet, pick up your money, okay? And the hard stuff was that. Really hard.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ What was the bet again?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, a lot of people said it\'s almost physically impossible for someone to go through 12 days.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat I didn\'t want to do was come back because I would have had to come back. And we would have been on this plane again in five weeks from now exactly to do four days. We were going to do four days and four days. And this way we did twelve, and we hit the big conferences, which is a big asset. So anyway.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ So you\'re not yet prepared to say that Roy Moore should --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I will see it when -- I mean, I basically put out a statement which was obvious. So I\'ll stick with statement for now, but I\'ll have further comment as we go down the road. I have to get back into the country to see what\'s happening.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Is there one thing that you were pressing President Xi on that you can say you\'re going to take away, where he changed his mind or agreed to something that you\'re looking to do specifically on North Korea?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: President Xi made a statement. If you read his statement yesterday -- were you all there when he was speaking and made the statement in the big room -- the Great Room?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHe made a statement that he\'s committed to stopping the nuclearization of North Korea. That\'s a big statement. He made that statement, and a lot of people didn\'t -- they didn\'t pick that up. I don\'t think it was -- because it was part of the speech. And somehow a lot people -- to me, that was a very big statement. I even looked up -- because I\\u2019m sitting waiting to speak -- and I said, wow, that\'s a big statement. He made that statement in his speech yesterday or the day before, when he made -- you know, when we were speaking together. He put a statement out, Sarah, that said he\'s committed to making that happen. That\'s a big statement.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know, he was, through this process -- he\'s the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Some people say more powerful than Mao. With that being said, I really believe he\'s a good person, he\'s a good man, he wants to do right, he\'s representing his people. He\'s strong, he\'s very strong. But you know, you look at some of what you saw was very impressive. It was very impressive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ What\'s the next thing you\'d like to see him do on Korea?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, I\'d like to have him ratchet it up, and I think he\'s doing that. We had a long talk about it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ But ratchet it up with what?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: And I was with him for hours. You know, I was with him -- like I sat with him. You were there at the beginning of that evening, right? Of the --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ No.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, really?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ I wasn\'t pool.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I was sitting with him. We were together for hours. And the day before, we were together for hours. And we get along very well. You know, it\'s easy to be with him for hours. Whereas, if you don\'t have chemistry, you people know, you can\'t be with somebody for two minutes. And we talked a lot about North Korea. We talked about a lot of things. We talked a lot about North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNo, I think he\'s going to ratchet it up. I did not speak to President Putin about it because we just had these little segments that we were talking about Syria. But President Putin would be tremendously helpful -- tremendously helpful -- if I had Russia and China helping us with North Korea, I think that would solve it. But this artificial barrier gets in the way. I call it the "artificial Democrat barrier." It gets in the way, which is a shame.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ So you didn\'t have time to ask Putin specific things on North Korea?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I wasn\\u2019t able to -- because I really didn\'t, Jennifer. I really just -- we did, like, little snippets in between. We didn\'t have a planned meeting. We spoke, but we didn\'t have a planned meeting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Where did you leave it with President Putin? Are you looking for another meeting? Him coming to the U.S.? Or are you --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: We\'ll have a meeting. I think we have the potential to have a very good relationship. I don\\u2019t know him like I know President Xi because I\'ve spent a lot of time with President Xi, but I think we have the potential to have a very, very good relationship. I have it with Abe. I have it with Abe. Very good.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Did you see Abe fall at the sand trap?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I didn\'t. I say this: If that was him, he is one of the greatest gymnasts because the way he -- (laughter) -- it was like a perfect -- I never saw anything like that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNo, wasn\'t it amazing? And he was standing up. I told him -- I said, I\'m not going to ask -- because it was shot from a helicopter. I said, I will not ask if that\'s you, but if it was, I\'m very impressed because you\'re better than any gymnast I\'ve ever seen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ What do you mean by "artificial Democratic barrier"? I mean, you and Putin can\'t warm up because of this investigation? Or what --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: There\'s an artificial barrier that puts in the way by the Democrats. It\'s a fake barrier. There was no collusion. Everybody knows there was no collusion. I mean, you speak to these people -- I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day and I respect her. She was on television the other day saying there\'s no collusion. The Democrats -- the Republicans come out screaming it, but the Democrats come out, and they say, "No, there\'s no collusion." There is no collusion. There\'s nothing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I think it\'s a shame that something like that can destroy a very important potential relationship between two countries that are very important countries. Russia could really help us. And the Democrats wanted to have a good relationship with Russia, but they couldn\'t do it because they didn\'t have the talent to do it. They didn\'t have the chemistry to do it. They didn\'t have what it takes to do it. You know, there is a talent to that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I think Putin and I -- President Putin and I would have a great relationship, and that would be great for both countries. And it would take a lot of the danger out because we\'re really -- you know, this is a dangerous time. This isn\'t small stuff. This is a very dangerous time. And having a great relationship, or even a good relationship, with the President of Russia -- Hillary tried it, and she failed. Nobody mentions that. They act like, you know -- it\'s so terrible. She did that reset button; it was a joke. But she tried and she failed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tObama tried and he failed. Couldn\'t have it, because he didn\'t have chemistry. They didn\'t have the right chemistry. And you know what? I understand that, because there are some people I don\'t have chemistry with. Let\'s see, some of you are right here. (Laughter.) There are some people I don\'t -- you know, sometimes if you don\'t have chemistry with somebody, you don\'t.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut Obama did not have the right chemistry with Putin. And Hillary was way over her head.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: Let\'s take one more and then let them have lunch.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Were you able to get any commitments -- when it comes to the trade balance, some of the issues you talk about like intellectual property theft -- did he make any commitments there to make changes?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: You know, the intellectual property -- you\'re talking about $300 billion a year. It\'s tremendous. We talked about it. But I said, we\'re friends, but this is a different administration than you\'ve had for the last 30 years. For the last 30 years, China -- and, in all fairness, and other countries. Look, we have a $71 billion trade deficit with Mexico. We have a $70 billion trade deficit with Japan. We have a $30 billion trade deficit with South Korea. I could go through a whole list. There are few countries we have a surplus with, and those countries it\'s like a two-dollar surplus. It\'s disgraceful.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I don\'t blame any of those countries. I blame the people that we had representing us who didn\'t know what they were doing. Because they should have never let it happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ I\'d like to ask a question on AT&amp;T and CNN. Do you want AT&amp;T to sell CNN for the --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I didn\'t make the decision. That was made by a man who\'s actually a very respected person -- a very, very respected person.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI did make a comment in the past as to what I think. I do feel that you should have as many news outlets as you can, especially since so many of them are fake. This way, at least you can get your word out. But I do believe you should have as many news outlets as you can.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, with that being said, I didn\'t make a statement on it, but I made that statement long before at the very early part. So we\'ll see how that -- it will probably end up being maybe litigation, maybe not. We\'ll see how it all plays out.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Did you talk to Xi about opening China to Twitter and other social media?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: About what?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Opening China to Twitter.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I mentioned it very briefly. Honestly, it wasn\'t number one on my list. Number one on my list with him was North Korea and trade. Those are the two I really spoke. I mentioned it, you know, briefly, but we\'ll talk. I\'m going to have plenty of time to talk. He\'ll come here next time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis all started in Florida, and it\'s a great feeling to have that kind of a relationship where you can really help your country. Because we can really help our country, and he can really help his country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we\'re going to be very tough on trade. This is not going to be like it was in the past. I did tell him that. This is not going to be the old days. This is a whole different thing going on.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, you know, it\'s not acceptable what\'s been happening with trade, generally. China, yes -- but generally. And I can think of almost no examples where it\'s good. It\'s all bad. We had the worst negotiators, whether it\'s the Iran deal or any other thing. We had the worst -- our trade deals are so bad. Last year, we lost $800 billion, right? Yeah. $800 [billion], approximately. Check it. But approximately $800 billion on trade. Why?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ You put your own guys in there now. So what did you get from him?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I have a great team. Bob Lighthizer. Bob Lighthizer is -- he\'s going to town. And he works with me. He works with me. But Bob is going to town.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I hope you\'re all enjoying yourselves. Tonight we\'re going to Hanoi.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Any highlights from APEC? Do you have any asks for the other countries?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I think the APEC was just -- good, very collegial.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Did anyone ask you for specific things?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: No, but I told them we\'re going to have much tougher trade policies now, because, you know, they have barriers. We don\'t. I\'m not only talking about tariffs. They have non-tariff barriers, and we don\'t. I said, you got to remove them.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tGood to be with you. Good to be with you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ll talk to you --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Thank you for coming back.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I\'ll see you in Hanoi. Are you all going up?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Yes, sir.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ We are.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t4:01 P.M.

EST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: It is an honor to be here, I have to tell you. You know, the Coast Guard, always respected. But if you were looking at it as a brand, there\\u2019s no brand that went up more than the Coast Guard, with what happened in Texas. And I would say, in particular, Texas has been incredible. You saved 16,000 lives -- nobody knows that -- 16,000 lives.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn fact, when I first heard the number, I said, you mean like, six hundred? Five hundred? Sixteen thousand lives in Texas. So, as bad as that hurricane was -- and that was a bad one. That was a big water job, right? It kept coming in and going back. They couldn\\u2019t get rid of it. They\\u2019ve never seen -- I guess it was the biggest water dump they\\u2019ve ever seen. But when you get 16,000 -- good to see this group of people. (Laughter.) But when you do 16,000, that\\u2019s really something.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd then Florida hit, and you know that one very well. You knew that one pretty well, right? The job you did in Florida. And then, Puerto Rico.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I really mean that. I think that there is no brand, of any kind -- I\\u2019m not just talking about a military brand -- that has gone up more than the Coast Guard. Incredible people. You\\u2019ve done an incredible job. And I love coming in here and doing this with you today. I think it\\u2019s -- well, we have to keep you very well fed. (Laughter.) This is good stuff. But it\\u2019s an honor.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd the First Lady, you know --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMRS. TRUMP: Happy Thanksgiving.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE: Happy Thanksgiving.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: And we went together to Texas, and we saw what you were doing. And you just followed that storm, right next to that storm. And you just -- you saved so many people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI still haven\\u2019t figured out how people take their boats out into a hurricane. Someday you\\u2019ll explain it. Gene was just telling me that they actually do it to save their boat, in many cases. But they\\u2019re not thinking about their life, they\\u2019re thinking about their boats. And, I don\\u2019t know -- I mean, they go out in a boat and they think, I guess, they\\u2019re -- you know, they\\u2019ve got a wonderful boat, they\\u2019ve had it for years, it can weather anything. And then they have 25-foot waves pushing out -- and that would be the end of them.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo you saved a lot of people. And I just want to thank you on behalf of the whole country and on behalf of us. What a job you\\u2019ve done, and thank you all very much. And I\\u2019ll also take questions if you have them.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, should we leave the media here to do the questions? (Laughter.) Or should we tell them to leave? You know what, it\\u2019s Thanksgiving, so let\\u2019s let the media stay. Okay?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnybody have any questions about the country, how we\\u2019re doing, or any of those things? I love it when you don\'t. (Laughter.) See, that means you\'re doing great. I love that. That\'s the greatest.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe press, I know, doesn\'t have any questions. If you do, we won\'t take them, but that\'s all right. (Laughter.) The press has plenty of questions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut the country is doing really well. Stock market, all-time high. This is all good stuff. I just spoke to a lot of your friends in Afghanistan and in Iraq. We spoke to the USS Monterey -- great ship, great missile ship. We spoke to a lot of different folks from the Air Force, the Army -- just now, a little while ago at Mar-a-Lago.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe telecommunications systems, what you can do now, we go live to Iraq, live to Afghanistan. I mean, it\\u2019s really incredible. But I told them our country is doing great. And you folks are fighting so hard and working so hard. And it\\u2019s nice that you\\u2019re working for something that\\u2019s really starting to work.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\\u2019ve cut back so much on regulation and all the waste, and all the abuse. And the stock market on Friday hit an all-time high. The highest it\\u2019s ever been, ever.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYour whole, long life, the stock market is higher than it\\u2019s ever been. And that means your 401(k), all of the things that you have, whether it\\u2019s -- even if you\\u2019re in the military, you have a country that\\u2019s really starting to turn.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe want to have a strong country. We want to have a country where I can buy new Coast Guard cutters and not have to worry about it, all right? And that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re doing, we\\u2019re building up wealth so that we can take care of our protection. And we\\u2019re ordering tremendous amounts of new equipment. We\\u2019re at $700 billion for the military. And, you know, they were cutting back for years. They just kept cutting, cutting, cutting the military. And you got lean, to put it nicely. It was depleted, was the word. And now it\\u2019s changing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Navy, I can tell you, we\'re ordering ships. With the Air Force, we\'re ordering a lot of planes, in particular the F-35 fighter jet, which is, you know, almost like an invisible fighter. I was asking the Air Force guys, I said, how good is this plane? They said, well, sir, you can\'t see it. I said, yeah, but in a fight -- you know, a fight -- like I watch in the movies -- they fight, they\'re fighting. How good is this? They say, well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it. Even if it\'s right next to it, it can\'t see it. I said, that helps. (Laughter.) That\'s a good thing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut, I mean, we have equipment that -- nobody has the equipment that we have. And it\'s sad when we\'re selling our equipment to other countries but we\'re not buying it ourselves, okay? But now that\'s all changed. And the stuff I said -- the stuff that we have is always a little bit better too. You know, when we sell to other countries, even if they\'re allies -- you never know about an ally. An ally can turn. You understand. You\'re going to find that out. But I always say, make ours a little bit better. You know, give it that extra speed. A little bit -- keep a little bit -- keep about 10 percent in the bag, because what we have -- nobody has like what we have, and that\'s what we\'re doing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we\'re really proud of the Coast Guard. And I\'m very proud -- I walked in today and Gene said, the day I got elected, the following morning they were putting up the statement that I made right on your front door -- right on your glass. And I came in and the first thing I noticed, of course -- I said, wow, look at that. And I said, did you put that up just for me because I happened to be coming here today? And you did that the first day, so that tells me something. That tells me something. Thank you. Special guys.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLet\'s go, fellas, come on. Let\'s get up here.

KST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT MOON: (As interpreted.) Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of President Trump\'s election victory. In Korea, we have a custom of holding a special celebration on one\'s first birthday. So after pondering about how to best celebrate the first anniversary of President Trump\'s victory, I decided to invite the President to Korea as a state guest and hold a banquet. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLadies and gentlemen, another big round of applause to congratulate President Trump. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI would like to extend my heartfelt welcome to President and Mrs. Trump, both of whom I highly respect, on their first visit to Korea. This is the first state visit by an American President in 25 years and the first state visit for me and my administration. I am very pleased to get this opportunity to repay so quickly the hospitality I received in Washington, D.C. last June.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOver the months, I have maintained close contact with President Trump. But now, after spending a day with the President and the First Lady within Cheong Wa Dae, I feel a sense of intimacy, as if we were old friends.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDistinguished guests, last September, in his keynote speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Trump recollected President Truman\'s great initiatives for rebuilding the free world in the aftermath of World War II. Thanks to President Truman\'s resolute decision, the U.S.-led U.N. forces participated in the war that broke out on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe ROK-U.S. alliance was born out of the same red blood of patriots spilt by Korean and American soldiers on the battlefield.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast June, I paid my respects at the Chosin Reservoir Battle memorial in Quantico. I convey my gratitude to the Korean War veterans for their honorable sacrifices, and reflect upon the noble values of the ROK-U.S. alliance that has defended freedom and peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEven at this very moment, the peace of my country, which was won with blood, is being threatened once again. But the ROK-U.S. alliance gives us the strength to stop this threat.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCamp Humphreys, where President Trump visited today, is the largest and most advanced U.S. military installation outside of the United States, and it is a symbol of the enduring strength of the ROK-U.S. alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLadies and gentlemen, war must not break out again on the Korean Peninsula. And in this respect, the United States has provided enormous support. The close coordination between Korea and the United States, and the overwhelming superiority of power that stems from the ROK-U.S. alliance, will eventually make North Korea cease its reckless provocations and make North Korea come out to dialogue for denuclearization.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe ROK-U.S. alliance of tomorrow will grow into a trustworthy pillar that guarantees the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and also builds peace and prosperity in all of Northeast Asia.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLadies and gentlemen, President Trump\'s election victory one year ago is already making America great again. Korea faces the task of making this world a better place through cooperation with a great America.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tKorea has worked with the United States for peace and reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are also working hand-in-hand with the United States to realize the common values of humanity, such as human rights and the eradication of poverty. I believe that making such joint efforts will make the ROK-U.S. alliance an even greater alliance as President Trump and I have agreed to do last June, and, at the same time, make America even greater.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow I would like to propose a toast. Please fill your glasses, and may I ask you to raise your glasses.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf you are ready: I give you my word that I will always stand by you on our journey to make the ROK-U.S. alliance an even greater alliance. I congratulate President Trump on the one-year anniversary of his election victory. And I would like to propose a toast to the good health of President and Mrs. Trump.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, thank you very much. And this is an exciting time, and we\'re going to have an exciting day tomorrow, for many reasons that people will find out, in addition to the fact I look forward to making a -- hopefully -- very comprehensive speech before you and the leaders of Korea. And that will be really something that I\'m representing the American people. The relationship that we have is a fantastic one.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I have to say, President Moon and First Lady Kim, thank you very much. I greatly appreciate your hosting Melania and myself on our first trip to the very beautiful Republic of Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe were honored to welcome you to the White House this past summer, and now it\'s a tremendous honor to visit your magnificent home -- and magnificent it is, to see this beautiful land, and to meet the remarkable people of South Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe partnership between our two nations and our two people is deep and enduring. We have been proud to stand by your side for many decades as an unwavering friend and a loyal ally. And you have never had a time where this ally has been more loyal or stood by your side more than right now.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHere in South Korea, the people built a free, sovereign, and democratic republic. Through their resilience and sacrifice and determination, they became the chief architects of the future. Today, the course of this great nation is charted solely by the free people of South Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President, your remarkable success truly demonstrates what is possible when people are free to follow their dreams, pursue their passions, and hope for a better future for their children.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTonight, we celebrate South Korea\'s success and affirm our close and abiding bonds of friendship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether, our nations remind the world of the boundless potential of societies that choose freedom over tyranny, and who set the free. And we will free, and we will sacrifice, and we will hope, and we will make things beautiful, especially the aspiration of your people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs true partners, we have remained faithful friends through periods of challenge and opportunity. And that\'s what we have now, is great opportunity. We will continue to support each other in the years ahead.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn that spirit, I would like to offer a toast to President Moon and First Lady Kim, and to the people of South Korea: May freedom and peace flourish on this peninsula. In our time, and for generations to come, this will be a special evening and a special time. May our bonds of friendship continue to deepen, and may the cherished hopes of our people and the people across the region soon be realized.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President, may your dreams come true. It\'s an honor to be with you. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.)</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t8:35 P.M.

KST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Assembly Speaker Chung, distinguished members of this Assembly, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the extraordinary privilege to speak in this great chamber and to address your people on behalf of the people of the United States of America.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn our short time in your country, Melania and I have been awed by its ancient and modern wonders, and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast night, President and Mrs. Moon showed us incredible hospitality in a beautiful reception at the Blue House. We had productive discussions on increasing military cooperation and improving the trade relationship between our nations on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThrough this entire visit, it has been both our pleasure and our honor to create and celebrate a long friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war, and strengthened by the trials of history. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean soldiers have fought together, sacrificed together, and triumphed together.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlmost 67 years ago, in the spring of 1951, they recaptured what remained of this city where we are gathered so proudly today. It was the second time in a year that our combined forces took on steep casualties to retake this capital from the communists.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOver the next weeks and months, the men soldiered through steep mountains and bloody, bloody battles. Driven back at times, they willed their way north to form the line that today divides the oppressed and the free. And there, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBy the time the armistice was signed in 1953, more than 36,000 Americans had died in the Korean War, with more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. They are heroes, and we honor them. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your country paid for their freedom. You lost hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMuch of this great city of Seoul was reduced to rubble. Large portions of the country were scarred -- severely, severely hurt -- by this horrible war. The economy of this nation was demolished.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut as the entire world knows, over the next two generations something miraculous happened on the southern half of this peninsula. Family by family, city by city, the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the great nations of the world. And I congratulate you. (Applause.) In less than one lifetime, South Korea climbed from total devastation to among the wealthiest nations on Earth.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, your economy is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. Trade has increased 1,900 times. Life expectancy has risen from just 53 years to more than 82 years today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLike Korea, and since my election exactly one year ago today, I celebrate with you. (Applause.) The United States is going through something of a miracle itself. Our stock market is at an all-time high. Unemployment is at a 17-year low. We are defeating ISIS. We are strengthening our judiciary, including a brilliant Supreme Court justice, and on, and on, and on.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCurrently stationed in the vicinity of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. In addition, we have nuclear submarines appropriately positioned. The United States, under my administration, is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world being built, right now. I want peace through strength. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe are helping the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. And, in the end, we will work things out far better than anybody understands or can even appreciate. I know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of the United States very long into the future. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat you have built is truly an inspiration. Your economic transformation was linked to a political one. The proud, sovereign, and independent people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. You secured free parliamentary elections in 1988, the same year you hosted your first Olympics.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tafter, you elected your first civilian president in more than three decades. And when the Republic you won faced financial crisis, you lined up by the millions to give your most prized possessions -- your wedding rings, heirlooms, and gold \\u201cluck keys\\u201d -- to restore the promise of a better future for your children. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYour wealth is measured in more than money -- it is measured in achievements of the mind and achievements of spirit. Over the last several decades, your scientists of engineers -- have engineered so many magnificent things. You\'ve pushed the boundaries of technology, pioneered miraculous medical treatments, and emerged as leaders in unlocking the mysteries of our universe.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tKorean authors penned roughly 40,000 books this year. Korean musicians fill concert halls all around the world. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates of any country. And Korean golfers are some of the best on Earth. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tfact -- and you know what I\'m going to say -- the Women\'s U.S. Open was held this year at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and it just happened to be won by a great Korean golfer, Sung-hyun Park. An eighth of the top 10 players were from Korea. And the top four golfers -- one, two, three, four -- the top four were from Korea. Congratulations. (Applause.) Congratulations. And that\'s something. That is really something.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHere in Seoul, architectural wonders like the Sixty-Three Building and the Lotte World Tower -- very beautiful -- grace the sky and house the workers of many growing industries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tcitizens now help to feed the hungry, fight terrorism, and solve problems all over the world. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. Good luck. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Korean miracle extends exactly as far as the armies of free nations advanced in 1953 -- 24 miles to the north. There, it stops; it all comes to an end. Dead stop. The flourishing ends, and the prison state of North Korea sadly begins.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWorkers in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. Recently, the entire working population was ordered to work for 70 days straight, or else pay for a day of rest.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFamilies live in homes without plumbing, and fewer than half have electricity. Parents bribe teachers in hopes of saving their sons and daughters from forced labor. More than a million North Koreans died of famine in the 1990s, and more continue to die of hunger today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAmong children under the age of five, nearly 30 percent of afflicted -- and are afflicted by stunted growth due to malnutrition. And yet, in 2012 and 2013, the regime spent an estimated $200 million -- or almost half the money that it allocated to improve living standards for its people -- to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat remains of the meager harvest of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime. Far from valuing its people as equal citizens, this cruel dictatorship measures them, scores them, and ranks them based on the most arbitrary indications of their allegiance to the state. Those who score the highest in loyalty may live in the capital city. Those who score the lowest starve. A small infraction by one citizen, such as accidently staining a picture of the tyrant printed in a discarded newspaper, can wreck the social credit rank of his entire family for many decades.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAn estimated 100,000 North Koreans suffer in gulags, toiling in forced labor, and enduring torture, starvation, rape, and murder on a constant basis.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn one known instance, a 9-year-old boy was imprisoned for 10 years because his grandfather was accused of treason. In another, a student was beaten in school for forgetting a single detail about the life of Kim Jong-un.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSoldiers have kidnapped foreigners and forced them to work as language tutors for North Korean spies.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the part of Korea that was a stronghold for Christianity before the war, Christians and other people of faith who are found praying or holding a religious book of any kind are now detained, tortured, and in many cases, even executed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNorth Korean women are forced to abort babies that are considered ethnically inferior. And if these babies are born, the newborns are murdered.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOne woman\\u2019s baby born to a Chinese father was taken away in a bucket. The guards said it did not \\u201cdeserve to live because it was impure.\\u201d</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo why would China feel an obligation to help North Korea?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe horror of life in North Korea is so complete that citizens pay bribes to government officials to have themselves exported aboard as slaves. They would rather be slaves than live in North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTo attempt to flee is a crime punishable by death. One person who escaped remarked, "When I think about it now, I was not a human being. I was more like an animal. Only after leaving North Korea did I realize what life was supposed to be."</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd so, on this peninsula, we have watched the results of a tragic experiment in a laboratory of history. It is a tale of one people, but two Koreas. One Korea in which the people took control of their lives and their country, and chose a future of freedom and justice, of civilization, and incredible achievement. And another Korea in which leaders imprison their people under the banner of tyranny, fascism, and oppression. The result of this experiment are in, and they are totally conclusive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen the Korean War began in 1950, the two Koreas were approximately equal in GDP per capita. But by the 1990s, South Korea\\u2019s wealth had surpassed North Korea\'s by more than 10 times. And today, the South\\u2019s economy is over 40 times larger. You started the same a short while ago, and now you\'re 40 times larger. You\'re doing something right.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tConsidering the misery wrought by the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been forced to take increasingly desperate measures to prevent its people from understanding this brutal contrast.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBecause the regime fears the truth above all else, it forbids virtually all contact with the outside world. Not just my speech today, but even the most commonplace facts of South Korean life are forbidden knowledge to the North Korean people. Western and South Korean music is banned. Possession of foreign media is a crime punishable by death. Citizens spy on fellow citizens, their homes are subject to search at any time, and their every action is subject to surveillance. In place of a vibrant society, the people of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNorth Korea is a country ruled as a cult. At the center of this military cult is a deranged belief in the leader\\u2019s destiny to rule as parent protector over a conquered Korean Peninsula and an enslaved Korean people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe more successful South Korea becomes, the more decisively you discredit the dark fantasy at the heart of the Kim regime.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn this way, the very existence of a thriving South Korean republic threatens the very survival of the North Korean dictatorship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis city and this assembly are living proof that a free and independent Korea not only can, but does stand strong, sovereign, and proud among the nations of the world. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHere, the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a tyrant. It comes from the true and powerful glory of a strong and great people -- the people of the Republic of Korea -- a Korean people who are free to live, to flourish, to worship, to love, to build, and to grow their own destiny.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn this Republic, the people have done what no dictator ever could -- you took, with the help of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. You had a dream -- a Korean dream -- and you built that dream into a great reality.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn so doing, you performed the miracle on the Hahn that we see all around us, from the stunning skyline of Seoul to the plains and peaks of this beautiful landscape. You have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis reality -- this wonderful place -- your success is the greatest cause of anxiety, alarm, and even panic to the North Korean regime. That is why the Kim regime seeks conflict abroad -- to distract from total failure that they suffer at home.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSince the so-called armistice, there have been hundreds of North Korean attacks on Americans and South Koreans. These attacks have included the capture and torture of the brave American soldiers of the USS Pueblo, repeated assaults on American helicopters, and the 1969 drowning [downing] of a U.S. surveillance plane that killed 31 American servicemen. The regime has made numerous lethal incursions in South Korea, attempted to assassinate senior leaders, attacked South Korean ships, and tortured Otto Warmbier, ultimately leading to that fine young man\'s death.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAll the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with the deluded hope that it could blackmail its way to the ultimate objective. And that objective we are not going to let it have. We are not going to let it have. All of Korea is under that spell, divided in half. South Korea will never allow what\'s going on in North Korea to continue to happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe North Korean regime has pursued its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in defiance of every assurance, agreement, and commitment it has made to the United States and its allies. It\'s broken all of those commitments. After promising to freeze its plutonium program in 1994, it repeated [reaped] the benefits of the deal and then -- and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 2005, after years of diplomacy, the dictatorship agreed to ultimately abandon its nuclear programs and return to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation. But it never did. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up. In 2009, the United States gave negotiations yet another chance, and offered North Korea the open hand of engagement. The regime responded by sinking a South Korean Navy ship, killing 46 Korean sailors. To this day, it continues to launch missiles over the sovereign territory of Japan and all other neighbors, test nuclear devices, and develop ICBMs to threaten the United States itself. The regime has interpreted America\\u2019s past restraint as weakness. This would be a fatal miscalculation. This is a very different administration than the United States has had in the past.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, I hope I speak not only for our countries, but for all civilized nations, when I say to the North: Do not underestimate us, and do not try us. We will defend our common security, our shared prosperity, and our sacred liberty.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe did not choose to draw here, on this peninsula -- (applause) -- this magnificent peninsula -- the thin line of civilization that runs around the world and down through time. But here it was drawn, and here it remains to this day. It is the line between peace and war, between decency and depravity, between law and tyranny, between hope and total despair. It is a line that has been drawn many times, in many places, throughout history. To hold that line is a choice free nations have always had to make. We have learned together the high cost of weakness and the high stakes of its defense.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAmerica\\u2019s men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, Communism and terrorism.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAmerica does not seek conflict or confrontation, but we will never run from it. History is filled with discarded regimes that have foolishly tested America\\u2019s resolve.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. We will not permit America or our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated. And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground, we fought and died so hard to secure. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat is why I have come here, to the heart of a free and flourishing Korea, with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world: The time for excuses is over. Now is the time for strength. If you want peace, you must stand strong at all times. (Applause.) The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens with nuclear devastation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAll responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea -- to deny it and any form -- any form of it. You cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We call on every nation, including China and Russia, to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions, downgrade diplomatic relations with the regime, and sever all ties of trade and technology.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt is our responsibility and our duty to confront this danger together -- because the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows, and the fewer the options become. (Applause.) And to those nations that choose to ignore this threat, or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean dictatorship: The weapons you are acquiring are not making you safer. They are putting your regime in grave danger. Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNorth Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. It is a hell that no person deserves. Yet, despite every crime you have committed against God and man, you are ready to offer, and we will do that -- we will offer a path to a much better future. It begins with an end to the aggression of your regime, a stop to your development of ballistic missiles, and complete, verifiable, and total denuclearization. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tA sky-top view of this peninsula shows a nation of dazzling light in the South and a mass of impenetrable darkness in the North. We seek a future of light, prosperity, and peace. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea if its leaders cease their threats and dismantle their nuclear program.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe sinister regime of North Korea is right about only one thing: The Korean people do have a glorious destiny, but they could not be more wrong about what that destiny looks like. The destiny of the Korean people is not to suffer in the bondage of oppression, but to thrive in the glory of freedom. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a victory for your nation. It is a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And it is our hope that, someday soon, all of your brothers and sisters of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYour republic shows us all of what is possible. In just a few decades, with only the hard work, courage, and talents of your people, you turned this war-torn land into a nation blessed with wealth, rich in culture, and deep in spirit. You built a home where all families can flourish and where all children can shine and be happy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis Korea stands strong and tall among the great community of independent, confident, and peace-loving nations. We are nations that respect our citizens, cherish our liberty, treasure our sovereignty, and control our own destiny. We affirm the dignity of every person and embrace the full potential of every soul. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether, we dream of a Korea that is free, a peninsula that is safe, and families that are reunited once again. We dream of highways connecting North and South, of cousins embracing cousins, and this nuclear nightmare replaced with the beautiful promise of peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUntil that day comes, we stand strong and alert. Our eyes are fixed to the North, and our hearts praying for the day when all Koreans can live in freedom. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. (Applause.) God Bless You. God Bless the Korean people. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t11:59 A.M.

And we\'re going to have a very busy full day ahead.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt is interesting that it is one year, as of tomorrow, that we had our election victory. And it was great victory, and a victory that made a lot of people very happy. And our country is doing very well from the standpoint of the economy. It\'s doing record numbers, record stock market, 17-year low. We have the lowest unemployment that we\'ve had in 17 years. And we\'ve created trillions and trillions of dollars of value for our country. So we\'re very happy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re now working on massive tax cuts for our people, especially our companies which produce jobs in our middle class. And I think that\'s going along very well. We hope we\'re going to be victorious and get that big tax cut which the American people want.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI had a great time at Camp Humphreys today visiting with the U.S. and the South Korean troops. They are very impressive. Thank you. And as we very easily remember, because it was so good -- we had lunch together with the troops. And we had the option of having a magnificent restaurant, a beautiful room, and I said, let\'s have it with the troops. And we were very happy about it. It\'s a great facility -- Camp Humphreys -- and it really is a very special place. Tremendous cost -- a lot of it spent by your government to make your country safe. And any time you spend wisely for the military, that\'s always a good thing to do.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd your military is becoming very strong. Our military is now going to be, very soon, at the strongest level. We\'re committed to spending $700 billion, and that number may even go up. For our military, we\'re ordering new jet fighters, new equipment of virtually every kind. We make the finest equipment in the world, and you\'re buying a lot of it, and we appreciate that. And you\'ll be buying a lot of our military equipment. There\'s nobody that comes close, whether it\'s the planes, the missiles, the ships -- anything you want to talk about -- there\'s nothing like what we do in that sense. And we appreciate your big purchase orders for military equipment.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe North Korea situation will be a discussion that we will have front and center. And hopefully something is going to be very successfully worked out on that. And trade is something that we always talk; it\'s one of my favorite subjects. I guess it\'s one of the reasons that I had that great, successful victory</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tlast year, at this time. So we\'ll be discussing trade also.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'d like to do much more business with South Korea, where South Korea is going to order a lot more. But the good news is, you will be ordering. I mean, we\'ve already worked on that. And through our representatives, the amount of equipment and things that you\'ll be ordering from the United States will be very substantially increased and therefore we\'ll be bringing the trade deficit way down, which is very important to our people. We have trade deficits with numerous countries, and we don\'t want to have trade deficits. So we appreciate that very much. And what you\'re getting is the finest equipment anywhere in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we\'ll discuss North Korea, we\'ll discuss trade, we\'ll discuss other things, and I really was honored by that ceremony today. That was a beautiful, beautiful ceremony at the highest level. No matter where you\'d go, you could never see that. That is just as beautiful as it can be, and it represented your country so well. And I just want to thank you for that. That was a real honor.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it\'s an honor to be with you, and I look forward to spending the rest of today and a good part of tomorrow on negotiating. We\'ll negotiate some of those good deals, both ways. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t\\xa04:16 P.M.

I think he should make it again, but it was good.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we\'ve had a great relationship. This has been very successful. We have many meetings today with many other leaders. And the ASEAN conference has been handled beautifully by the President in the Philippines and your representatives. And I\'ve really enjoyed being here. The weather is always good. Today it\'s pretty good. But one thing about the Philippines -- eventually it gets good, no matter what.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we very much appreciate the great treatment you\'ve given us. I thought last night\'s event was fantastic. Tremendous talent -- most of it, I guess, from the Philippines. But tremendous talent -- musical talent, dance talent.

That was good with me. And thank you for representing, Bill, so well the interests of the American people in Japan and the incredible relationship that you have with Japan. We really appreciate it. You\'re doing a fantastic job. We very much appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLet me begin today by addressing the horrific shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of today\'s horrible and murderous attack. This act of evil occurred as the victims and their families were in their place of sacred worship. We cannot put into words the pain and grief we all feel, and we cannot begin to imagine the suffering of those who lost the ones they so dearly loved.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur hearts are broken, but in dark times -- and these are dark times -- such as these, Americans do what they do best: We pull together. We join hands, we lock arms, and through the tears and through the sadness, we stand strong -- oh, so strong.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy administration will provide its full support to the great state of Texas and all local authorities investigating this horrible crime. I\'ve spoken just a few minutes ago with Governor Abbott, and we offer our thanks to the first responders, the FBI, all of the many people involved, both federal and otherwise. Ultimately, they stopped the suspect and rendered immediate lifesaving aid to certain victims of the shooting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI will continue to follow the developments closely. All of America is praying to God to help the wounded and the families of the victims. We will never, ever leave their side -- ever.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith that being said, we are here today in Japan with one of our closest and most cherished allies, through bad times and good times, through rain and through shine. I want to thank Secretary Tillerson -- Rex -- who has done a tremendous job of leading the dedicated men and women of the Department of State here in Japan and around the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe splendor and beauty of Japan has left a lasting impression on me and my family. And I want to thank the First Lady for being with us, Melania. Please stand. (Applause.) She\'s become a very, very popular First Lady, I can tell you that. Whenever I speak, they have hundreds of signs out in the audience. We love our First Lady, which is so true. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd our warmest admiration for this ancient culture. It\'s an ancient culture and its customs are ancient, and it\'s terrific. Over the weekend, Ivanka attended the World Assembly for Women with Prime Minister Abe, who I was with all day yesterday. I applaud the Prime Minister -- and he\'s a terrific person, by the way -- for his dedication to advancing women in the workforce. And I share his commitment to empowering women in business and in all professions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis morning, I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss how we can strengthen and improve the economic ties between the United States and Japan. And I have to say, for the last many decades, Japan has been winning. You do know that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor the, actually, last 70 years, cooperation between our two countries has helped us to pioneer incredible advances in commerce, in science, medicine, and technology. Our students study together, our scholars exchange ideas, and business leaders like you work together to invest in a better, more prosperous future for both of our nations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI know many of the leaders in this room have helped build Japan into the center for commerce and innovation that it is today. And I want to commend you for your incredible achievements in so many areas. And I looked at a list of the people in the room -- they are truly the leaders of industry. I congratulate you all. Names that, in many cases, I haven\\u2019t met, but I know you well, from reading about you on the covers of every business magazine and sometimes well beyond the business magazines. So, congratulations. Fantastic job you\'ve done in building some of the greatest companies in the world. And it\'s an honor to be working with you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe want to thank and make the United States for the people in this room, and well beyond this room, the most attractive place for you to hire, invest, and to grow. That\'s why we are very, very substantially lowering our taxes. The United States is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. But it\'s also a market like no other; by far, the biggest market in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIts numbers are phenomenal over the last -- since November 8th, Election Day. Our unemployment is at a 17-year low. We\'ve gotten almost 2 million more people in the workforce in just that short period of time. I\'ve reduced regulations terrifically, frankly, if I do say so myself -- but at a level that nobody else has ever done. I\'ve done more in nine months in terms of the reduction of regulations than any President has done in a full term, and it\'s not even close. And if it were close, they will let you know about it tomorrow morning, believe me. They will tell you about it, but it\'s not even close.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe stock market reached an all-time high on Friday, and that\'s the 61st, I believe -- something around that number -- 61st time that\'s happened. So we have a lot of happy people in this room because your stocks are right in there. And look at you, you\'re smiling. Very happy. (Laughter.) What company? What company?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPARTICIPANT: ANA.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, that\'s another big one. That\'s a great company. Are you happy? You happy with the job?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPARTICIPANT: (Inaudible.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Good. Come around, give me your hand. (Applause.) That is some company, too. Congratulations, you\'ve done a great job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut it\'s reached an all-time high. I believe it\'s maybe in the neighborhood of 61 times during the course of -- from November 8. And so we\'re honored by that. GDP growth, very importantly, we hit 3.2 last quarter -- 3.2 And this time we hit 3, and we figure a good point -- I would say a good solid point for hurricanes. We had four horrific hurricanes, as everybody knows, and did tremendous damage to Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and Louisiana, and even Alabama was affected, and other places -- Georgia.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we figured at least a point. So I was going to close my eyes a little bit when the numbers came out. And the number came out at 3. That would mean that it would have been 4. And GDP at 4 was unthinkable, actually unthinkable, when I was running. And I said we could do it. They were saying maybe you could hit 2, 2.5. My first quarter was 1. We were in the ones. And so we\'re at 3, and now 3.2. And again, without the hurricanes, I think we would have been 4 or very close to 4. So that\'s GDP of 4. That was not something that people thought of in the first three or four years, and we\'ve already hit it. And we will continue to.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn regulations, while I\'ve reduced regulations terrifically. It would take, as an example, to build a highway -- it would take 17 to 20 years to get approvals. And at the end of 20th year, in many cases, they voted it down. Do you approve? No. So they wasted tens of millions of dollars. There\'s a highway in Maryland where it took exactly 17 years. And the original numbers were very little, and it ended up costing hundreds of millions of dollars for a very small, short highway. And we can\'t have that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we\'re trying to bring that number down from -- anywhere from 13 to 20 years. We\'re trying to bring it down to one year. You want to build a road? You want to build a highway? You want to build a school? You want to build a factory -- most importantly, to the folks in this room -- or a plant? You\'re going to have your approvals very, very quickly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, you may be rejected quickly, too. But that\'s okay. If you\'re rejected quickly -- you don\'t want to be rejected at the end of the 17th year. I approved a power plant, which has been under consideration for 11 years, and they gave up, and I approved it. And it\'s a $7 billion plant. And the state wanted it and the local community wanted it, but they had environmental restrictions. And now it\'s being built.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Dakota Access Pipeline and, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline, that was rejected by the previous administration. The Keystone Pipeline was dead. And the Dakota Access Pipeline was in even in worse shape because they built it but they weren\'t allowed to hook it up. So I consider not starting even better than that. And in my first week, I approved both. It\'s 42,000 jobs. The Dakota is already open and Keystone is starting; it\'s actually already started. And that was done in the first week -- got it approved.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we have many other things like that. I could stand here all day and tell you additional events that we\'ve done that create jobs and are good for our country, not bad for our country. When you want to build your auto plants, you will have your approvals almost immediately. When you want to expand your plants, you will have your approvals almost immediately. And in the room, we have a couple of the great folks from two of the biggest auto companies in the world that are building new plants and doing expansions of other plants. And you know who you are, and I want to just thank you very much. I want to thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also want to recognize the business leaders in the room whose confidence in the United States -- they\'ve been creating jobs -- you have such confidence in the United States, and you\'ve been creating jobs for our country for a long, long time. Several Japanese automobile industry firms have been really doing a job. And we love it when you build cars -- if you\'re a Japanese firm, we love it -- try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over. Is that possible to ask? That\'s not rude. Is that rude? I don\'t think so. (Laughter.) If you could build them. But I must say, Toyota and Mazda -- where are you? Are you here, anybody? Toyota? Mazda? I thought so. Oh, I thought that was you. That\'s big stuff. Congratulations. Come on, let me shake your hand. (Applause.) They\'re going to invest $1.6 billion in building a new manufacturing plant, which will create as many as 4,000 new jobs in the United States. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we\'re very pleased that just last month, Denso announced that it will invest $1 billion to expand its activities in Tennessee, a great state -- great state --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAMBASSADOR HAGERTY: (Inaudible) right here, Mr. President.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: I know, I\'m going to introduce him now. And create over 1,000 new jobs. And I do believe that\'s you -- another famous man. Come here. (Applause.) Great state. You\'re going to love being there.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd again, it\'s really terrific. You watch, it\'s going to be -- it\'s going to go so smoothly. And the process is a much easier process now. So, thank you. Thank you both very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to thank these companies, but I want to thank all of the companies that are coming in. Many companies have announced now that they\'re coming into the United States to do plants, to do factories, to move. You saw Broadcom is coming in -- top 100 company -- they announced on Thursday from the Oval Office. Anytime you\'d like to expand a second -- see, I don\\u2019t have to do that now because you\'ve already announced, so I don\\u2019t have to bother. But if you do a little more expansion, we\'ll do it from the Oval Office, you two, all right? (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we just did that announcement from the Oval Office. And Foxconn is coming in with a massive plant that is going to be in Wisconsin. And that was very exciting. They do the Apple iPhones, and it\'s going to be a tremendous success.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut we have to do more. The United States has suffered massive trade deficits with Japan for many, many years. Almost $70 billion annually. Seventy billion. Many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan, and our car industry is doing very well and our product is fantastic. So we\'ll have to negotiate that out, and we\'ll do it in a very friendly way, and I know it\'s going to be a successful negotiation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd one thing I can say -- that we make the greatest military equipment in the world. There\'s nothing close. And the Prime Minister is ordering a lot of military equipment, as he should be -- as he should be with what\'s happening with one of your neighbors. So that is happening.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe had a case yesterday, as you know, where a missile was shot into Saudi Arabia, and their missile system defense -- took the missile right out of the air, blew it up. Incredible talent, incredible technology that we have. Incredible. The accuracy that you can stop something like that, it\'s like a needle in the air going very, very fast. And, just, we make incredible equipment, whether it\'s the planes, the missiles -- anything you can think about. There\'s nobody even close. So we\'re going to be doing a lot of business with many countries on defense.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe want fair and open trade. But right now, our trade with Japan is not fair and it\'s not open, but I know it will be, soon. We want free and reciprocal trade, but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it\'s not reciprocal. And I know it will be. And we\'ve started the process, and it\'s gone on for a long time, but I know that we will be able to come up with trade deals and trade concepts that are going to be fair to both countries, and, actually, I think will actually be better for both countries. And I have no doubt that it will be done in a quick and very friendly manner.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\'m very optimistic about the future of our economic partnership. We are proud, for instance, that, after the United States, Japan is the largest owner of Boeing aircraft. Greatest commercial aircraft in the world. (Applause.) Is Boeing here? Boeing?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPARTICIPANT: Right there, for Boeing --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Oh, look at my guy. Stand up. Boy, have I made him -- (applause) -- come, come.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(Inaudible.) You know, Melania had some of your stock. You know what happened? When I won, she was forced to sell it. (Laughter.) Fantastic. Great job you\'re doing. And I do love the F-18 also. I love the F-18.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we\'re joined this morning also by Ray Washburne. Where\'s Ray? Stand up. What are you doing in the back of the room like that, Ray? Since when have you become shy? (Applause.) Ray was with us from the beginning. Right from the day I announced, Ray felt very strongly about it. And Ray is now the CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, or OPIC, and Ray is working with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation to invest in bold, new infrastructure projects. This is a major development that will advance our shared interests in the region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to thank you for doing such a great job. From day one, the day I met you -- perfect job. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd in partnership with the United States, the sovereign nations of the Indo-Pacific will work together to achieve a future of security, prosperity, and peace. We will have more trade than anybody ever thought of under TPP, that I can tell you. TPP was not the right idea. Probably some of you in this room disagree, but ultimately I\'ll be proven to be right. We will have much bigger trade with the way we\'re doing it right now, and it will be a much less complex situation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe cherish the friendship between the United States and Japan. And I cherish my friendship with Prime Minister Abe. We welcome more Japanese investments into the United States. We believe that a balanced economic partnership will unlock new frontiers for discovery, unleash new prosperity for our citizens, and improve the lives of millions and millions of people all around the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re grateful for everything you do to promote opportunity in both Japan and the United States. We look forward to many years of cooperation, innovation, collaboration, and unbelievable trade -- unbelievable trade. It\'s happening and it\'s going to happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I want to thank everybody for being here today. Again, you are the rock stars of business. Amazing people. I hope your family recognize how important you are. Oftentimes, they don\'t. Right? (Laughter.) But you really are. You\'re the rock stars of business, and it\'s an honor to be with you.

And we will work with Prime Minister Abe on trying to get them back to their loved ones.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn some cases, many years ago, they were taken. They were used to learn the language.

(In progress) -- this government and Chinese people extending warm welcome to President Trump on your state visit to China.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom yesterday afternoon to the present, we have had in-depth exchange of ideas on China-U.S. relations and important issues of shared interest. We reached many common understandings. We both believe that China-U.S. relations are important to the wellbeing of our two peoples, and bear on peace, stability, and prosperity of the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor China and the United States, cooperation is the only viable choice, and win-win cooperation can take us to a better future. We agree that China-U.S. relations have made important progress this year. We have agreed to further promote strategic guidance of summit diplomacy for bilateral relations; strengthen interactions at high and all levels; make the most of the four high-level dialogue mechanisms; expand interactions and cooperation on economy and trade, mil-to-mil relations, law enforcement, people-to-people exchange, and in other areas; enhance communication and cooperation on the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, Afghanistan, and other major international and regional issues; and work together to take China-U.S. relations to even greater development.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe China-U.S. relationship now stands at a new starting point. China is ready to work with the United States to enhance cooperation and properly manage differences in a spirit of mutual respect and mutual benefit. This way, it will enable our two peoples, the region, and people across the world to benefit more from China-U.S. relations. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTRUMP: Mr. President, thank you very much. It\'s an honor to be with you. There can be no more important subject than China-U.S. relation. We have, between us -- and we have to include some other countries which would quickly come in -- we have a capacity to dissolve world problems for many, many years to come.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur meeting last night was absolutely terrific. Our dinner was beyond that. We had a dinner that was going to last quickly -- 20, 25 minutes -- because I was traveling and you were so nice, and you said, we\'ll just do a quick dinner. And I think it had to last at least two hours, and we enjoyed every minute of it with your beautiful wife and Melania together. Their relationship is a great one, and our relationship has already proven to be a great one.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur meeting this morning, in front of your representatives and my representatives, was excellent, discussing North Korea -- and I do believe there\'s a solution to that, as you do; discussing trade with the United States, knowing that the United States really has to change its policies because they\'ve gotten so far behind on trade with China and, frankly, with many other countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I have great respect for you for that, because you\'re representing China. But it\'s too bad that past administrations allowed it go get so far out of kilter. But we\'ll make it fair, and it will be tremendous for both of us.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy feeling toward you is an incredibly warm one. As we said, there\'s great chemistry, and I think we\'re going to do tremendous things for both China and for the United States. And it is a very, very great honor to be with you. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe hosting of the military parade this morning was magnificent, and the world was watching. I\'ve already had people calling from all parts of the world.

Nothing you can see is so beautiful.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I just want to thank you for the very warm welcome, and I look forward to many years of success and friendship, working together to solve not only our problems but world problems, and problems of great danger and security.

And since the launch of my new administration, this is the first state visit that I\'m receiving from overseas. I would like to warmly welcome you and Mrs. Trump both to Korea and to Cheong Wa Dae.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I hope that I will have an opportunity to repay the warm hospitality that I received from you when I visited Washington, D.C. in June.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I heard this past Sunday there was some tragic news from Texas. I believe that you would have the even more heavier heart because you were traveling overseas when this happened. On behalf of the Korean government and the Korean people, I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to you, Mr. President, and the American people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd also, I would like to congratulate you in advance.

It is good to know that both of us are doing very well.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I would also like to commend you on your efforts in leading the international collaboration and unity when it comes to countering North Korea nuclear issue.

EST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. As you probably have heard, and some of you have reported, a missile was launched a little while ago from North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI will only tell you that we will take care of it. We have General Mattis in the room with us, and we\'ve had a long discussion on it. It is a situation that we will handle.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith that being said, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi did not show up for our meeting today. I\'m not really that surprised. We have a lot of differences. They\'re weak on crime, they\'re weak on illegal immigration. They want the illegal folks to come pouring into our border and a lot of problems are being caused, although we\'ve stopped it to a large extent as much as you can without the law, which we\'re going to get.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBefore this meeting and before this missile launch, they\'ve been weak on military. In terms of spending, they\'re very hard to get the military -- they want it for a lot of other things, but the military is always secondary to them. The military, to me, is number one. We won\'t be here without our powerful military, and we\'re building it up stronger, bigger, better than ever before. And General Mattis can testify to that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd the other thing: They want tax increases, and we want major tax decreases. So they decided not to show up. They\'ve been all talk and they\'ve been no action, and now it\'s even worse. Now it\'s not even talk. So they\'re not showing up to the meeting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI will say this: In light of the missile launch, probably they\'ll be here fairly quickly, or at least discussions will start taking place fairly quickly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI think we\'re in a very good position in terms of the meeting we just had over at the Capitol with the Republican senators. It was outstanding. I think we have tremendous support. I was just informed by Mitch that we had a unanimous vote -- from the Republican side at least -- we had a unanimous vote on the tax bill. And it goes now the next step, and I think we\'re going to get it passed. I think it\'s going to pass. And it\'s going to be very popular.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s going to have lots of adjustments before it ends, but the end result will be a very, very massive -- the largest in the history of our country -- tax cut. And lots of good things are going to happen, including the bringing back to our country of -- probably will end up being over $4 trillion -- money offshore that\'s stagnant that companies -- they\'re just not able to bring it back. So I think it\'s going to be a number over $4 trillion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCorporate will be able to compete now against the world. If you look at China, if you look at so many other countries, if you look at many of the countries, China is at 15 percent. They\'re lower than us. We\'re getting it down to a level that is either going to be lower or right in the ballpark so we can compete much better with our companies -- our great, great companies. And that means jobs and it means lots of other things.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\'m very happy to see that the consumer confidence level is just about the highest it\'s ever been. If fact -- I don\'t want to make any mistakes in front of the press because you\'ll get me on it -- but to the best of my knowledge, it\'s the highest it\'s ever been. Consumer confidence has been setting records. They have confidence in the people leading their country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, I will say, that I think it\'s going to go better and better, and I do believe this vote on taxes, which are really tax cuts and reform, is going to be very, very important.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we had a good day today. We had a phenomenal meeting with the Republican senators. We had -- it was very special that meeting. And, in many respects, I wish you could have been inside that room. It was very, very special -- the comradery. It was somewhat of a lovefest. They want to see it happen. They want to see it happen not only for the Republican Party. I think, much more importantly, they want to see it happen for the country because they know how important it is for us to compete and win.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, with that, I maybe will start with Paul Ryan to say a few words about where we stand with different things and then I\'ll ask Mitch McConnell.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSPEAKER RYAN: Okay. I\'ll just briefly say I think it\'s regrettable that our Democratic colleagues and leadership chose not to join us today for a bill to become a law. Congress has to pass a bill, and the President signs a bill. That means Congress and the White House always negotiate legislation. We have important work to do. We have big deadlines to do. We have a military in need of our support, and that work needs to happen now.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I just think it\'s very regrettable that our Democratic colleagues and leadership chose to not participate because we have to negotiate these bills to get this work done for the people we represent and especially to help our military with these difficult situations we have. And I just hope that our friends in leadership on the other side of the aisle will choose to participate so we can get the people\'s work done.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLEADER MCCONNELL: Mr. President, I would just add I\'ve been in this position under a couple of previous Presidents. I can\'t recall ever turning down an opportunity to go down to the White House.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs the Speaker mentioned, only one person in America can sign a bill into law, and that\'s the President of the United States. You cannot negotiate the year-end -- the omnibus spending bill without the person who signs the bill in the room.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I think the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate need to understand the way the government works, and the administration has to be a part of the ultimate negotiation over what the spending level is going to be for the next year.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Well, we are very far apart because our views on crime and our views on immigration and the military -- so many are different. But a lot of things have happened, even over the last two hours with respect to the missile launch. We want our military funded and we want it funded now. It\'s going to be bigger, better, stronger -- it already is -- than ever before. But we want to get going on that now. So that is a difference, in all fairness, from this morning when I told them that we\'re way, way far away.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd with that, I may just have General Mattis say just a couple of words about what he has found out. General, do you want to say just a couple of little pieces of information to the media?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSECRETARY MATTIS: Mr. President, Senator, Speaker, a little over two and a half hours ago, North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile. It went higher, frankly, than any previous shot they\'ve taken. It\'s a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that could threaten everywhere in the world, basically.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd in response, the South Koreans have fired some pinpoint missiles out into the water to make certain North Korea understands that they could be taken under fire by our ally.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut the bottom line is, it\'s a continued effort to build a threat -- a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace, and certainly, the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, General. And we will take care of that situation. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Does this change anything to your basic approach to North Korea, these missile launches today? Does it change anything about your basic approach to dealing with them?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Nothing changed. Nothing changed. We have a very serious approach, but nothing changed. We take it very seriously.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Do you believe there will be a government shutdown, Mr. President? And would you blame Democrats if that happens?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Well, if that happens, I would absolutely blame the Democrats. If it happens, it\'s going to be over illegals pouring into the country, crime pouring into the country, no border wall -- which everybody wants. I got elected partially because of the border wall.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf you look at the military, we want strong funding for the military. They don\'t. So many things. As an example, they want high taxes; we want to cut taxes. We\'re going to cut taxes. We\'re going to reform. We\'re going to simplify. They want high taxes; we want low taxes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo there\'s a lot of big differences. So we\'ll see what happens as to shutdown. We\'ll see. But right now, things have changed over the last two hours, because two hours ago, a missile was launched. I think that will have a huge effect on Schumer and Pelosi -- I think. We\'ll see. We\'re going to learn very soon.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThey should be calling immediately and saying, "We want to see you." But probably they won\'t, because nothing to them is important other than raising taxes. That\'s the only thing they like doing is raising taxes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you all very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t3:50 P.M.

EST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast night, I returned from a historic 12-day trip to Asia. This journey took us to five nations to meet with dozens of foreign leaders, participate in three formal state visits, and attend three key regional summits. It was the longest visit to the region by an American President in more than a quarter of a century.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEverywhere we went, our foreign hosts greeted the American delegation, myself included, with incredible warmth, hospitality, and most importantly respect. And this great respect showed very well our country is -- further evidence that America\\u2019s renewed confidence and standing in the world has never been stronger than it is right now.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen we are confident in ourselves, our strength, our flag, our history, our values -- other nations are confident in us. And when we treat our citizens with the respect they deserve, other countries treat America with the respect that our country so richly deserves.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDuring our travels, this is exactly what the world saw: a strong, proud, and confident America.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, I want to update the American people on the tremendous success of this trip and the progress we\\u2019ve made to advance American security and prosperity throughout the year.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen I came into office, our country was faced with a series of growing dangers. These threats included rogue regimes pursuing deadly weapons, foreign powers challenging America\\u2019s influence, the spread of the murderous terror group ISIS, and years of unfair trade practices that had dangerously depleted our manufacturing base and wiped out millions and millions of middle-class jobs.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe challenges were inherited, and these products really showed what previous mistakes were made over many years -- and even decades -- by other administrations. Some of these mistakes were born of indifference and neglect. Others from na\\xefve thinking and misguided judgement. In some cases, the negative influence of partisan politics and special interests was to blame. But the one common thread behind all of these problems was a failure to protect and promote the interests of the American people and American workers.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUpon my inauguration, I pledged that we would rebuild America, restore its economic strength, and defend its national security. With this goal in mind, I vowed that we would reaffirm old alliances and form new friendships in pursuit of shared goals. Above all, I swore that in every decision, with every action, I would put the best interests of the American people first.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOver the past 10 months, traveling across the globe and meeting with world leaders, that is exactly what I have done.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEarlier this year, in Saudi Arabia, I spoke to the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations about our strategy to defeat terrorists by stripping them of financing, territory, and ideological support. And I urged the leaders to drive out the terrorists and extremists from their societies. Since that time, we have dealt ISIS one crushing defeat after another.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Israel, I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between America and the Jewish State, and I met with leaders of the Palestinian Authority and initiated an effort to facilitate lasting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Brussels, I urged our NATO allies to do more to strengthen our crucial alliance and set the stage for significant increases in member contributions. Billions and billions of dollars are pouring in because of that initiative. NATO, believe me, is very happy with Donald Trump and what I did.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Warsaw, I declared to the world America\\u2019s resolve to preserve and protect Western civilization and the values we hold so dear.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Rome, Sicily, Hamburg, and Paris, I strengthened our friendships with key allies to promote our shared interests of security and prosperity.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn September, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, I urged that the nations of the world join in confronting rogue regimes that threaten humanity and laid out a model for international cooperation grounded in respect for sovereignty and the responsibilities that come with it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn each trip, I have worked to advance American interests and leadership in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd to each of these places, I have carried our vision for a better -- a vision for something stronger and sovereign -- so important -- sovereign and independent nations, rooted in their histories, confident in their destinies, and cooperating together to advance their security, prosperity, and the noble cause of peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt was this same vision that I carried to Asia two weeks ago. And it was this same commitment to you, the American people, that was always at the forefront of my mind and my thinking.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur trip was defined by three core goals. First: to unite the world against the nuclear menace posed by the North Korean regime, a threat that has increased steadily through many administrations and now requires urgent action.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSecond: to strengthen America\\u2019s alliances and economic partnerships in a free and open Indo-Pacific, made up of thriving, independent nations, respectful of other countries and their own citizens, and safe from foreign domination and economic servitude.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd third: to finally -- after many years -- insist on fair and reciprocal trade. Fair and reciprocal trade -- so important. These two words -- fairness and reciprocity -- are an open invitation to every country that seeks to do business with the United States, and they are a firm warning to every country that cheats, breaks the rules, and engages in economic aggression -- like they\'ve been doing in the past, especially in the recent past.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat is why we have almost an $800-billion-a-year trade deficit with other nations. Unacceptable. We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith these goals, it was my profound honor to travel on this journey as your representative. I explained to all of the world leaders, and across Asia, how well the United States is doing. Economic growth has been over 3 percent the last two quarters and is going higher. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. The stock market has gained trillions of dollars in value since my election and has reached record highs. We are massively increasing our military budget to historic levels. The House has just passed a nearly $700 billion defense package, and it could not come at a better time for our nation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOnce again our country is optimistic about the future, confident in our values, and proud of our history and a role in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to thank every citizen of this country for the part you have played in making this great American comeback possible. In Asia, our message was clear and well received: America is here to compete, to do business, and to defend our values and our security.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe began our trip in Hawaii to pay our respects to brave American servicemembers at Pearl Harbor and the United States Pacific Command, the guardian of our security and freedom across the Indo-Pacific region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tour country prepared to observe Veterans Day, we remembered the incredible sacrifices and courage of all of the veterans whose service has preserved our liberty and a way of life that is very special. We also thanked military families for their support for our brave servicemen and women.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom Hawaii, we traveled to Japan, a crucial U.S. ally and partner in the region. Upon landing in Japan, my first act was to thank the American servicemembers and Japanese Self-Defense Forces who personify the strength of our enduring alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPrime Minister Abe and I agreed on our absolute determination to remain united to achieve the goal of denuclearized North Korea. Shortly following our visit, Japan announced additional sanctions on 35 North Korean entities and individuals. Japan also committed to shouldering more of the burden of our common defense by reimbursing costs borne by American taxpayers, as well as by making deep investments in Japan\\u2019s own military. This will include purchases of U.S. advanced capabilities -- from jet fighters to missile defense systems worth many, many billions of dollars -- and jobs for the American worker.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Prime Minister and I also discussed ways we can deepen our trade relationship based on the core principles of fairness and reciprocity. I am pleased that since January of this year, Japanese companies have announced investments in the United States worth more than $8 billion -- 17,000 jobs. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOh, they don\'t have water? That\'s okay. What? That\'s okay.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(Drinks water.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Japanese manufacturers, Toyota and Mazda, announced that they will be opening a new plant in the United States that will create 4,000 jobs.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also signed agreements between our nations to enhance infrastructure development, increase access to affordable energy, and advance our foreign policy goals through economic investment.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom Japan, we traveled to another key American ally in Asia -- the Republic of Korea. My official state visit to South Korea was the first by an American President in 25 years.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSpeaking before the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea, I spoke the truth about the evil crimes of the North Korean regime, and I made clear that we will not allow this twisted dictatorship to hold the world hostage to nuclear blackmail.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI called on every nation, including China and Russia, to unite in isolating the North Korean regime -- cutting off all ties of trade and commerce -- until it stops its dangerous provocation on -- and this is the whole key to what we\'re doing -- on denuclearization. We have to denuclearize North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe have ended the failed strategy of strategic patience, and, as a result, we have already seen important progress -- including tough new sanctions from the U.N. council -- we have a Security Council that has been with us and just about with us from the beginning.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSouth Korea agreed to harmonize sanctions and joined the United States in sanctioning additional rogue actors whose fund and funds have helped North Korea and North Korea\'s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. It\'s unacceptable to us.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States welcomed the decision of President Moon to remove the payload restrictions on missiles to combat the North Korean threat. And together we reaffirmed our commitment to a campaign of maximum pressure.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLike Japan, South Korea is increasing its defense contributions. During our meetings, President Moon acknowledged his desire for equitable cost-sharing for the United States military forces stationed in South Korea. And I visited soldiers at Camp Humphreys, a brand-new, joint American-South Korean base, paid for almost entirely by the South Korean government. At that base, I discussed with the United States and South Korean military leaders both military options and readiness to respond to North Korean provocation or offensive actions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDuring our visit, President Moon and I also discussed America\\u2019s commitment to reducing our trade deficit with South Korea. At my discretion and direction, we are currently renegotiating the disastrous U.S.-Korea trade agreement signed under the previous administration. It has been a disaster for the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLast week, 42 South Korean companies announced their intent to invest in projects worth more than $17 billion dollars in the United States, and 24 companies announced plans to purchase $58 billion dollars in American goods and services.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom South Korea, Melania and I traveled to China, where, as in Japan and South Korea, we were greatly honored by the splendor of our reception. Our trip included the first official dinner held for a foreign leader in the Forbidden City since the founding of the modern China, where we enjoyed a very productive evening hosted by President Xi and his wonderful wife, Madam Peng.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDuring our visit, President Xi pledged to faithfully implement United Nations Security Council resolutions on North Korea and to use his great economic influence over the regime to achieve our common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Xi recognizes that a nuclear North Korea is a grave threat to China, and we agreed that we would not accept a so-called \\u201cfreeze for freeze\\u201d agreement like those that have consistently failed in the past. We made that time is running out and we made it clear, and all options remain on the table.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also had very candid conversations with President Xi about the need to reduce our staggering trade deficit with China and for our trading relationship to be conducted on a truly fair and equitable basis. We can no longer tolerate unfair trading practices that steal American jobs, wealth, and intellectual property. The days of the United States being taken advantage of are over.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn China, we also announced $250 billion worth in trade-investment deals that will create jobs in the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom China, I flew to the city of Da Nang in Vietnam, to attend the Leaders Meeting for APEC -- Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. There, I spoke to a major gathering of business leaders, where I reminded the world of America\\u2019s historic role in the Pacific as a force for freedom and for peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tStanding on this proud history, I offered our vision for robust trading relationships in which Indo-Pacific nations can all prosper and grow together. I announced that the United States is ready to make bilateral trade deals with any nation in the region that wants to be our partner in fair and reciprocal trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will never again turn a blind eye to trading abuses, to cheating, economic aggression, or anything else from countries that profess a belief in open trade, but do not follow the rules or live by its principles themselves.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNo international trading organization can function if members are allowed to exploit the openness of others for unfair economic gain. Trade abuses harm the United States and its workers -- but no more. No more.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will take every trade action necessary to achieve the fair and reciprocal treatment that the United States has offered to the rest of the world for decades.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy message has resonated. The 21 APEC leaders -- for the first time ever -- recognized the importance of fair and reciprocal trade, recognized the need to address unfair trade practices, and acknowledged that the WTO is in strong need of reform. These leaders also noted that countries must do a better job following the rules to which they agreed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also made very clear that the United States will promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in which nations enjoy the independence and respect they deserve.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Vietnam, during a state visit in Hanoi, I also met with President Quang and Prime Minister Fook to discuss the growing friendship between our countries. Our Vietnamese partners are taking new actions to enforce sanctions on North Korea. In addition, we committed to expand trade and investment between our countries, and we pledged to address the imbalances. I am particularly pleased that the United States and Vietnam recently announced $12 billion in commercial agreements, which will include $10 billion in U.S. content.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFinally, I visited the Philippines, where I met with numerous world leaders at the U.S.-ASEAN and East Asia Summits. At ASEAN -- the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- we made it clear that no one owns the ocean. Freedom of navigation and overflight are critical to the security and prosperity of all nations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also met with the Prime Ministers of India, Australia, and Japan to discuss our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDuring our visit, President Duterte of the Philippines thanked the American people and our armed forces for supporting the recent liberation of Marawi from ISIS. We pledged to strengthen and deepen our long-standing alliance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAt the East Asia Summit, the United States negotiated and signed four important leaders\\u2019 statements on the use of chemical weapons, money laundering, poverty alleviation, and countering terrorist propaganda and financing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd crucially, at both summits and throughout the trip, we asked all nations to support our campaign of maximum pressure for North Korean denuclearization. And they are responding by cutting trade with North Korea, restricting financial ties to the regime, and expelling North Korean diplomats and workers.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOver the last two weeks, we have made historic strides in reasserting American leadership, restoring American security, and reawakening American confidence.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEverywhere we went, I reaffirmed our vision for cooperation between proud, independent and sovereign countries -- and I made clear that the United States will be a reliable friend, a strong partner, and a powerful advocate for its own citizens.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe momentum from our trip will launch us on our continued effort to accomplish the three core objectives I outlined: to unite the world against North Korean nuclear threat, to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and to advance fair and reciprocal economic relations with our trading partners and allies in the region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe have established a new framework for trade that will ensure reciprocity through enforcement actions, reform of international organizations, and new fair trade deals that benefit the United States and our partners.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we have laid out a pathway toward peace and security in our world where sovereign nations can thrive, flourish, and prosper side-by-side.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis is our beautiful vision for the future. This is a where this vision -- this dream -- is only possible if America is strong, proud, and free.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tlong as we are true to ourselves, faithful to our founding, and loyal to our citizens, then there is no task too great, no dream too large, no goal beyond our reach.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy fellow citizens: America is back. And the future has never looked brighter.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

past.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPeople were taking advantage -- countries were taking advantage of the United States, more than just this region, but the world.\\xa0 And those days are over.\\xa0 We\'re going to be fair, we\'re going to be reciprocal.\\xa0 As I said in my remarks before:\\xa0 We will be reciprocal, meaning if they\'re doing it, we\'re doing it.\\xa0 And that\'s the

And I think that number is going to be quadrupled very quickly.\\xa0 So that\'s over a trillion dollars\' worth of stuff.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tI think we have done a really fantastic

excellent.\\xa0 Japan and South Korea have been excellent.\\xa0 I think that\'s a very important part of the trip.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd the other important part to me was trade and relationships.\\xa0 The Philippines is an unbelievably important military location because if you speak to the admirals and you speak to the generals, that\'s a perfect spot.\\xa0 And, as you know, we had no relationship for a long period of time in the Philippines, and now we have a very good relationship there.\\xa0 We\'re back with the Philippines.\\xa0 So, strategically, we have a very important location -- maybe the most important strategic location in that area.\\xa0 So it\'s good.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tWe had a great time.\\xa0 I hope you guys are all okay.\\xa0 You all look

Wednesday, at the White House?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I think we\'re going to go into details of what I said.\\xa0 Were you there before, when I -- I think we\'ll be going into some more details as to what we\'re doing, as to what we accomplished.\\xa0 But, specifically, deals, concepts.\\xa0 And we\'ll be pinpointing things.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tBut, you know, it\'s minimum $300 billion, and that\'s going to be very quickly over a trillion dollars, that in itself.\\xa0 And I would say that\'s the least significant thing that we accomplished.\\xa0 I think one of the things we really accomplished big is relationship, and also letting people know that from now on, things are going to be reciprocal.\\xa0 We can\'t have trade deficits of $30, $40, $50 billion; $300 billion in the case of China.\\xa0 We can\'t do that.\\xa0 We have to have reciprocal trade.\\xa0 What\'s good for them is good for us.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 Why are those relationships so important?\\xa0 And is there a risk of getting too close to President Xi?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, relationship is always important.\\xa0 It doesn\'t mean it\'s necessarily close.\\xa0 It\'s really a relationship based on respect.\\xa0 To me, a relationship based on respect is much more important than anything else, including friendship.\\xa0 Because this is really something -- they have to respect our country.\\xa0 And they have not respected our country for a long period of time.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThank

war.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tMr. President, thank you for being such a gracious host during my time right here in Vietnam.\\xa0 I toured areas of Vietnam, and it is magnificent what\\u2019s happening.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tOver the past two decades, our nations have continued to grow closer in advancing our shared interests.\\xa0 The history of our two nations reveals the possibilities for peace and progress in our world.\\xa0 Moving forward as partners, we will achieve great prosperity and success for the American people and for the Vietnamese people.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tI thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 (As interpreted.)\\xa0 President Tr\\u1ea7n \\u0110\\u1ea1i Quang, I\'m from Vietnamese Agency.\\xa0 Can you elaborate of progress in the Vietnam-U.S. relations over the past few years?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\\xa0 (As interpreted.)\\xa0 Over the past years, the Vietnam-U.S. relations have made very strong progress in all areas -- politics, diplomacy, economy, trade, science and technology, health, humanitarian areas, and people-to-people exchange.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd, in particular, high-level contacts, meetings, and exchange of delegations on the basis of the comprehensive partnership have produced substantive and meaningful results.\\xa0 And, among them, the visit to the United States by Prime Minister Nguy\\u1ec5n Xu\\xe2n Ph\\xfac in May this year, and the state visit to Vietnam of Honorable President Donald Trump in the very first year of his term of office are the highlights.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tMeetings between leaders of Vietnam and the President during his visit are very useful, and the meetings give us the opportunity to understand each other better and to work together on areas of mutual interest.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThe substantive and effective growth of the comprehensive partnership between the two countries have been, and will be, delivering benefits to our two peoples and contributing to the maintenance of peace, stability, cooperation, and prosperity in the region and the world.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThank you.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 I\'m from VTV and have another question for President Tr\\u1ea7n \\u0110\\u1ea1i Quang.\\xa0 Can you please provide your assessment of the future outlook of the Vietnam-U.S. relationship?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\\xa0 (As interpreted.)\\xa0 Thank you for your question.\\xa0 Well, during the talks that I had with the President, we acknowledged that there is still much room for further expansion of the bilateral relations, and we discussed ways and means to further strengthen the cooperation in a more substantive and effective manner in the time to come.\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd the two sides also pledged to increase contacts and dialogues, especially the high-level meetings through bilateral visits and meetings at the sidelines of the regional and international forums.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThe two sides will also promote the momentum for development of the economic and trade investment relations on the basis of mutual interest, minimize the trade investment disputes, and will continue to effectively implement the economic and trade agreements that we have signed.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tWe\'ll also strengthen cooperation in science and technology, environment, climate change, humanitarian issues, human resources development, and expanding people-to-people exchange -- for the enhanced comprehensive partnership, the interest of the two peoples and for the benefit of peace, stability, cooperation, and development in the region and the world.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And if I could throw a little bit of a change up here, I\'ll ask both leaders a question as opposed to just one.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tMr. President, to you, if we could first.\\xa0 On the way here to Hanoi, from Da Nang, you talked about your meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday in which you said you received further assurances from him that he did not meddle in the U.S. election.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP:\\xa0 That\'s true.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 There was some uncertainty that brewed back in the United States over your statement that you said, "When he tells me that, I believe that he means it."\\xa0 That was taken in some circles, including Senator John McCain, to think that you believe that he is saying he did not interfere in the election.\\xa0 Could you, once and for all, definitively, sir -- yes or no -- say whether or not you believe that President Putin and/or Russia interfered in the election?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP:\\xa0 What I said there, I\'m surprised that there\'s any conflict on this.\\xa0 What I said there is that I believe he believes that, and that\'s very important for somebody to believe.\\xa0 I believe that he feels that he and Russia did not meddle in the election.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAs to whether I believe it or not, I\'m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted with their leadership.\\xa0 I believe in our intel agencies, our intelligence agencies.\\xa0 I\'ve worked with them very strongly.\\xa0 There weren\\u2019t seventeen as was previously reported; there were actually four.\\xa0 But they were saying there was seventeen; there were actually four.\\xa0 But as currently led by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tNow, at the same time, I want to be able -- because I think it\'s very important -- to get along with Russia, to get along with China, to get along with Vietnam, to get along with lots of countries, because we have a lot of things we have to solve.\\xa0 And, frankly, Russia and China in particular can help us with the North Korea problem, which is one of our truly great problems.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo I\'m not looking to stand and start arguing with somebody when there\'s reporters all around and cameras recording and seeing our conversation.\\xa0 I think it was very obvious to everybody.\\xa0 I believe that President Putin really feels -- and he feels strongly -- that he did not meddle in our election.\\xa0 What he believes is what he believes.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tWhat I believe is that we have to get to work.\\xa0 And I think everybody understood this that heard the answer.\\xa0 We have to get to work to solve Syria, to solve North Korea, to solve Ukraine, to solve terrorism.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd, you know, people don\'t realize Russia has been very, very heavily sanctioned.\\xa0 They were sanctioned at a very high level, and that took place very recently.\\xa0 It\'s now time to get back to healing a world that is shattered and broken.\\xa0 Those are very important things.\\xa0 And I feel that having Russia in a friendly posture, as opposed to always fighting with them, is an asset to the world and an asset to our country, not a liability.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd, by the way, Hillary Clinton had the reset button.\\xa0 She wanted to get back together with Russia.\\xa0 She even spelled "reset" wrong.\\xa0 That\'s how it started, and then it got worse.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPresident Obama wanted to get along with Russia, but the chemistry wasn\'t there.\\xa0 Getting along with other nations is a good thing, not a bad thing -- believe me.\\xa0 It\'s a good thing, not a bad thing.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tOkay, second.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 President Quang, if I could ask a question of you.\\xa0 There are some people who believe that Vietnam could make an effective facilitator in bringing the United States and North Korea together to at least lay the groundwork, potentially, for negotiations.\\xa0 What do you believe Vietnam could bring to the table in that regard?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\\xa0 (As interpreted.)\\xa0 On North Korea issue, Vietnam is committed to seriously observing all the relevant resolution at the UNSC, and we support the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\\xa0 And we\'ll do our utmost and do whatever we can to contribute to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThank you.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tQ\\xa0 \\xa0 You tweeted this morning about trying very hard to be friends with Kim Jong-un.\\xa0 Is that really a possibility?\\xa0 What would it take for that to happen at this point?<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tAnd for President Quang, could you comment on the President\'s offer to mediate the South China Sea dispute?\\xa0 Thank you.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP:\\xa0 Steve, I think anything is a possibility.\\xa0 Strange things happen in life.\\xa0 That might be a strange thing to happen, but it\'s certainly a possibility.\\xa0 If that did happen, it would be a good thing for -- I can tell you -- for North Korea.\\xa0 But it would also be good for lots of other places, and it would be good for the world.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tSo, certainly, it is something that could happen.\\xa0 I don\'t know that it will, but it would be very, very nice if it did.<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tPRESIDENT QUANG:\\xa0 (As interpreted.)\\xa0 With regard to the South China Sea issue, I have shared my thoughts with President Donald Trump on the recent developments in this area.\\xa0 And it is our policy to settle disputes in the South China Sea through peaceful negotiations, and with respect for diplomatic and legal process, in accordance with international law, including the 1982 U.N. Convention on Law of the Sea.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0<br/>\\n\\tThank you very much.\\xa0\\xa0<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND<br/>\\n\\t\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t\\xa010:48 A.M.

CST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT XI: (As interpreted.) The Honorable President Trump and Mrs. Trump, ladies and gentleman, dear friends: Good evening. As we often say in China, what a joy it is to have friends come from afar. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I once again extend a warm welcome to you, President Trump, on your state visit to China.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlthough there is a vast ocean between China and the United States, distance has never prevented our two great nations from coming together. And we have never stopped our efforts to pursue friendship and win-win cooperation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tForty-five years ago, President Nixon visited China, a visit that reopened the door of exchanges between China and the United States. As he rightly pointed before leaving China, it was a week that changed the world. Since then, thanks to the joint efforts of several generations of leaders and the people of our two countries, historic progress has been made in China-U.S. relations. It has benefitted our two peoples. Indeed, it has changed the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHow time flies. Over the past 45 years, historic changes have taken place in the world, in China, and in China-U.S. relations. The Cold War is a thing of the past. The world today is experiencing tremendous progress, profound transformation, and major adjustments. China has embarked on path of reform and opening up, and socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tChina and the United States once walked with animosity, have grown into a community with our interests closely converging. Today, our two countries share far more and broader common interests, as well as greater and stronger responsibilities in upholding global peace and promoting common development. The strategic dimension and global influence of China-U.S. relationship have continued to grow.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Trump, the state visit to China is another event of historic importance. Over the past two days, we have had in-depth exchange of views on how China and the United States should seize the opportunity, rise up to the challenges, and open up new grounds in our relations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether, we have mapped out a blueprint for advancing China-U.S. relations. We both agree that China and the United States should remain partners, not rivals. We both agree that when we work together, we can accomplish many great things to the benefit of our two countries and the whole world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI have also briefed President Trump on the 19th International Congress of the Communist Party of China, and this is my message: The 19th Party Congress will bring even more opportunities for China\'s cooperation with the United States and other countries. Indeed, the Chinese dream is closely connected with the dreams of people of all other countries in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Honorable President Trump and Mrs. Trump, ladies and gentlemen, dear friends: One has to make (inaudible) efforts to fulfill one\'s dream. As an old Chinese adage goes, "No distance, not even remote mountains and vast oceans can ever prevent people with perseverance from reaching their destination." Benjamin Franklin, one of America\'s Founding Fathers, also said, "He who can have patience, can have what he will."</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt is my firm conviction that China-U.S. relations face limited challenges, but boundless potential for growth. With perseverance, we can surely write a new chapter in the history of China-U.S. relations. With perseverance, our two great nations will definitely make new contribution to creating a better future for mankind.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow please join me in a toast to the prosperity of China and the United States and the wellbeing of our people. To the friendship between China and the United States, and between our people and to the health of you, President Trump, Mrs. Trump, and all our sides present, cheers. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t(A toast is offered.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you so much. That was so nice. And this has been an extraordinary few days. President Xi, your generous words. I must say, Melania -- we both want to express our gratitude to you and Madam Peng for the extraordinary hospitality that you\'ve shown us from the moment we arrived in your magnificent country, China.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYesterday, we visited the Forbidden City, which stands as a proud symbol of China\\u2019s rich culture and majestic spirit. Your nation is a testament to thousands of years of vibrant, living history.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd today, it was a tremendous honor to be greeted by the Chinese delegation right here at the Great Hall of the People. This moment in history presents both our nations with an incredible opportunity to advance peace and prosperity alongside other nations all around the world. In the words of a Chinese proverb, "We must carry forward the cause and forge ahead into the future." I am confident that we can realize this wonderful vision, a vision that will be so good and, in fact, so great for both China and the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThough we come from different places and faraway lands, there is much that binds the East and West. Both of our countries were built by people of great courage, strong culture, and a desire to trek across the unknown into great danger. But they overcame.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe people of the United States have a very deep respect for the heritage of your country and the noble traditions of its people. Your ancient values bring past and future together into the present. So beautiful.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt is my hope that the proud spirits of the American and Chinese people will inspire our efforts to achieve a more just, secure, and peaceful world, a future worthy of the sacrifices of our ancestors, and the dreams of our children.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn a moment, we will view a video of my granddaughter, Arabella, reciting traditional Chinese songs and poetry about your country\'s serene beauty and treasured customs. Our children so often remind us of our shared humanity and true dignity.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Xi, on behalf of the American people, I offer this to toast to you, to the people of your country, and to a friendship that will only grow stronger and stronger over many years to come.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. This has been a great honor to be with you both. We very much appreciate it.

And I appreciate the incredible rollout that they\'ve given to the United States -- not just the President of the United States, but the United States as a whole.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ve had an incredible day in Vietnam. The APEC meeting started it out, and that was a tremendous success. And thank you very much for hosting it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to just wish my best in condolences for the situation that you have with Damrey. That was tough. That was very, very tough. And I know you\'re handling it well. And our best wishes and condolences.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also want to thank you for helping us with the U.S. embassy site where we have a new embassy. And it will be something that, I think, will be very good for the future and the future of our two countries.<br/>\\n<br/>\\n\\tThe North Korean situation continues to be a problem. I think that China -- as you know, we saw -- we were in China yesterday and the day before. And President Xi, I think, is going to be a tremendous help. I hope Russia, likewise, will be a tremendous help. I think they can make a big difference.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI know that South Korea and Japan are very much unified in the sense that they want to be able to take care of a problem that\'s right next to them. Really, they\'re neighbors. And I appreciate all of the good work you\'re doing with regard to the North Korean problem.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSouth China Sea -- as you know, we\'re looking at -- we\'re looking at it together. If I could help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know. I know we\'ve had a dispute for quite a while with China. If I can help in any way, I\'m a very good mediator and a very good arbitrator. I have done plenty of it from both sides. So if I can help you, let me know.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur defense ties are terrific. We\'re doing a lot of business with you in terms of your purchasing of materials and also purchasing of very substantial military equipment. And we appreciate that. It\'s jobs for America, and you get the best equipment in the world. Nobody makes it like we make it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I think that more than anything else, this will be a meeting of trade. We will be a great trade partner, and whether we\'ll be treated fairly -- past administrations didn\'t understand trade and didn\'t know too much about what was going on with trade. But we do. But we also know how to do a lot of trade. So I think it\'s going to very, very good for Vietnam.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, Mr. President, I just again want to thank you for being so respectful and nice to my entire delegation and to its President. And on behalf of the United States of America, we wish you very well and a great respect for what Vietnam has been able to accomplish and do in a very, very short period of time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I want to give you a personal congratulations.

EST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: Good morning. We just returned from a historic 12-day trip to Asia. Everywhere we went, the American delegation was greeted with tremendous hospitality and tremendous respect. People are respecting our country again, believe me.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe brought back more than $300 billion worth of deals, which could reach well over a trillion dollars within a very near future. That means jobs for the United States at a very high level.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs you know, we\'ve just come up with the best job performance in over 17 years. But this is a lot more jobs, and we think the number is going to actually get a lot better. We\'re going to also put a lot of people that have not been able to find jobs, we\'re going to put them back to work -- because they\'re not registered right now; they\\u2019ll be registered in a positive sense.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJapanese car companies will be opening up and expanding their plants in our country. We worked very closely with Prime Minister Abe on that. We\'re renegotiating our bad trade deal with South Korea, and we\'ve started talking about bilateral trade with many countries in Asia.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd most importantly, we\'ve made clear to all countries that we cannot continue to be treated unfairly when it comes to trade any longer. It\\u2019s not fair to our companies, and it\\u2019s not fair to our workers. Last year, we lost over $800 billion on trade -- on trade deals with other countries. So we had a negative number, a trade deficit of almost $800 billion with other countries. That\'s not going to be happening. That\'s changing. And I explained that to them. From the standpoint of Asia, they understand it. Every one of them understand it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOne of the primary goals of our trip was to pursue the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I want to begin this morning by meeting and by talking about the fact that we will be instituting a very critical step, and that will start right now. Today, the United States is designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism. It should have happened a long time ago. It should have happened years ago.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn addition to threatening the world by nuclear devastation, North Korea has repeatedly supported acts of international terrorism, including assassinations on foreign soil.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we take this action today, our thoughts to turn to Otto Warmbier, a wonderful young man, and the countless others so brutally affected by the North Korean oppression. This designation will impose further sanctions and penalties on North Korea and related persons, and supports our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the murderous regime that you\'ve all been reading about and, in some cases, writing about.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTomorrow, the Treasury Department will be announcing an additional sanction, and a very large one, on North Korea. This will be going on over the next two weeks. It will be the highest level of sanctions by the time it\'s finished over a two-week period.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe North Korean regime must be lawful. It must end its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile development, and cease all support for international terrorism -- which it is not doing.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, Cabinet discussions will also focus on crucial domestic policy issues. I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for passing a vital and historic tax cut last week, and I\'m very hopeful the Senate will do the same very soon.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas. Hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith the Democrats giving us no votes for tax cuts, for purely political reasons -- obstructionists -- it will be up to the Republicans to come through for America. I think they will. I hope they will. It\'s up to the Senate. And if they approve it, the House and the Senate will get together -- I\'ll be there right in the middle of it -- and we will come up with a bill that will be spectacular for growth and spectacular for the people of this country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur tax plan will be bring urgent relief to hardworking families. We\'ll reduce rates, increase the amount of income taxed at a rate of zero, expand the Child Tax Credit -- very important, and simplify taxes as most family will be able to file on a single sheet of paper. We\'ll restore America\'s competitive edge so we can bring back our jobs. We want to bring our jobs back to our country. We were decimated over the last 40 years. We want to bring our jobs back to the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ll go from being one of the highest-taxed nations in the world to one of the lowest-taxed nations in the world. Corporate rate will be reduced from 35 percent all the way down to 20 percent, which will make us competitive again, and companies won\'t be leaving our country. Finally, our tax plan will return trillions of dollars in wealth to our shores so that companies can invest in America again.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAt the same time, we\'re working to reduce wasteful government spending. We will hear from budget director, Mick Mulvaney, who is working with my Cabinet to find taxpayer savings in each and every department.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Cabinet members that are with us today are working on getting reductions through their various departments, and we think we\'re going to be able to save a lot of money -- even lower than the budgets, in the budgets that we\'re submitting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ll be working on healthcare, infrastructure, and welfare reform. We\'re looking very strongly at welfare reform, and that will all take place right after taxes -- very soon, very shortly after taxes. So we\'ll be submitting plans on healthcare, plans on infrastructure, and plans on welfare reform -- which is desperately needed in our country -- soon after taxes.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, we\'ll also discuss the opioid epidemic that is ravaging so many American families and communities. Last week, I was proud to nominate Alex Azar to serve as the next Secretary of Health and Human Services. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm his nomination, and I want to thank Acting Secretary Eric Hargan for serving with such devotion and for doing such a great job in the meantime. Thank you very much, Eric.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFinally, I want to wish the American people a truly happy and blessed Thanksgiving, especially to our brave men and women serving in our military and our Border Patrol and ICE agents along the very dangerous southern border. As you heard, we lost a Border Patrol officer just yesterday, and another one was brutally beaten and badly, badly hurt. Looks like he\'ll make it, but very, very badly hurt.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we talk about the wall -- we\'re going to have the wall. It\'s a part of what we\'re doing. We need it. It\'s rough territory. That\'s where the drugs are coming in. A lot of things are happening along the border -- the southern border -- and we\'re going to straighten it out.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ve already reduced the numbers -- and you see the numbers -- they\'re back to 78 percent down from what they were. And those numbers will get better and better but we have to stop the massive drug flow from pouring in. And my respect to the families that were so badly hurt yesterday, because they were devastating. Those two families were devastated.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI just want to wish everybody a very, very Happy Thanksgiving. We\'re going to be working very hard during the recess in Florida. We\'re going to Florida. And I want to thank you all for being here, and let\'s start our meeting. And to the media, to the press, thank you very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.

And I\'ve got five deployed units bravely representing each branch of our armed forces. And we\'re going on live right now, and surrounding me is a lot of press. Better me than you -- believe me, fellas. Better me than you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s an honor to speak with you all and to give God thanks for the blessings of freedom and for the heroes who really have this tremendous courage that you do to defend us and to defend freedom. So we want to thank you all very much. Very, very special people. It doesn\'t get more special.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tRepresenting the Army, we have the First Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne who are conducting operations in Kandahar, Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom\'s Sentinel.

That\'s good news.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut, Toby Magsig, Happy Thanksgiving to all of you. And I have to say, just directly to the folks in Afghanistan, everybody is talking about the progress you\'ve made in the last few months since I opened it open. We opened it up. We said go ahead, we\'re going to fight to win. We\'re not fighting anymore to just walk around. We\'re fighting to win. And you people are really -- you\'ve turned it around over the last three to four months like nobody has seen. And they are talking about it. So, thank you very much -- brave, incredible fighters.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tDirect Support Team Golf of the Marine Corps Special Operations is also on the line. These great Marines are operating in Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. Major Jonathan Rigline is the commanding officer. Semper Fi.

And, Major, to you and to all the Marines doing this great work in delivering defeat after defeat to ISIS -- what you\'re doing with ISIS is, again, being talked about. We\'re being talked about again as an armed forces. We\'re really winning. We know how to win, but we have to let you win. They weren\'t letting you win before; they we\'re letting you play even. We\'re letting you win.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also want to say hello to Captain Dave Stoner and all of the sailors abroad the USS Monterey, sailing in support of both the 6th and 5th fleets. The Monterey\'s primary missions include ballistic missile defense, anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-submarine warfare. Thank you to everyone aboard the USS Monterey for your dedication. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re also joined by the 74th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron from Incirlik Air Base. Lieutenant Colonel Craig Morash, your squadron has done a tremendous job -- tremendous -- and we appreciate it. The fight against ISIS, it\'s coming our way -- coming our way. Big, big difference. A lot of things have happened. They say we\'ve made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration, and that\'s because I\'m letting you do your job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou\'re performing more than 1,000 missions over the skies of Iraq and Syria in the last four months. We\'re very, very proud of you. And believe me, everybody in this country is watching and they\'re seeing, and they\'re seeing positive reports for a change, instead of the neutral and negative reports. It\'s all positive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTo the Coasties aboard the Cutter Wrangell: Welcome and Happy Thanksgiving. Lieutenant Brian Hudson, you and the entire crew abroad the Wrangell are doing incredible work in the Arabian Gulf, performing theater security, defense operations, and maritime infrastructure protection. Thank you very much for your service. Very important area.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor each of you, I know it\'s very hard to be away from home at this time of the year. We\'re doing well at home. The economy is doing really great. When you come back, you\'re going to see with the jobs and the companies coming back into our country and the stock market just hit a record high. Unemployment is the lowest it\'s been in 17 years. So you\'re fighting for something real, you\'re fighting for something good.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tA lot of things have happened with our country over the last very short period of time, and they\'re really good -- they\'re really good. I especially like saying that companies are starting to come back. Now we\'re working on tax cuts -- big, fat, beautiful tax cuts. And hopefully we\'ll get that and then you\'re going to really see things happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo as we give thanks for this holiday, I know I speak on behalf of all Americans when I say that we totally support you. In fact, we love you -- we really do. We love you. And this is a thanksgiving that you won\'t forget. You\'re in a very different part of the world than you were used to, but, boy, are you doing a job there. And thank God for you. Thank God for you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also want to give thanks to our loved ones -- our amazing military families. I know they miss you, and they miss you so deeply and so badly. They\'re every bit as important as every else you work with because they put up with so much. They put up with the time away and all of those things that they have to endure. And they endure it because they love our country and because they love you. And believe me, I know so much about military families. They respect and appreciate what you\'re doing for this country, and they respect and appreciate what you\'re doing for them, as a family. So your families love you and they miss you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd again, I\'m going to now -- I\'m surrounded by reporters and press, and I\'m going to ask them to leave, and we\'re going to have very confidential, personal conversations. We\'re set up for that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou know, it\'s really wonderful what technology can do. So I\'ll ask the press to get out, and I\'ll say, "You\'re fired."

It is my great pleasure to meet all of you, together with President Trump. Let me begin by extending once again warm welcome to the President for his state visit to China.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYesterday and earlier today, the President and I have had in-depth discussions on China-U.S. relations and major international and regional issues of mutual interest. We reviewed the important progress made in the relationship since we met at Mar-a-Lago. And we discussed how to further move forward the relationship in the months ahead in great depth. And we reached a series of new and important consensus. Our meeting is constructive and productive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI shared with the President the policies adopted at the 19th Party Congress. I conveyed China\'s firm commitment to deeper reform, greater opening up, and a path of peaceful development, and China\'s desire to expand converging interests with other countries and promoting coordination and cooperation among major countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPresident Trump shared with me his domestic reform agenda and foreign policy priorities. The development of China and the United States is mutually reinforcing. Without contradicting each other, our respective success serves the common interests of both countries. We believe that facing the complex and changing international landscape, in maintaining world peace and stability, in promoting global development and prosperity, China and the United States, being two large countries, share more common interests, shoulder greater responsibility, and enjoy broader room for cooperation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tA healthy, stable and growing China-U.S. relationship is not only in the fundamental interest of the Chinese and American people, it also meets the expectations of the international community. For China and the United States, win-win cooperation is the only right choice and the pathway toward a better future.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe agreed to keeping close touch through mutual visits, meetings, phone calls, and correspondence with a view to having timely communications on major issues of shared interest.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe agreed to make the most of the diplomatic and security dialogue, comprehensive economic dialogue, social and people-to-people dialogue, and law enforcement and cyber security dialogue, four high-level dialogue mechanisms, and work together for greater results out of these dialogues.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe believe that China and the United States are the two largest economies and important engines of global economic growth. We need to further expand trade and investment cooperation, strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, pursue healthy, stable, and dynamically balanced economic and trade relations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt is necessary to formulate and launch economic cooperation plan for the next phase to have continued in-depth discussion on trade imbalance, export, investment environment, market openness, and other issues, and work to support practical cooperation in energy, infrastructure, Belt and Road Initiative, and other areas.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJust now, the President and I witnessed the signing of some major cooperation agreements by our businesses. During this visit, the two sides signed over $250 billion U.S. dollars of commercial deals and two-way investment agreements.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAccording to China\'s timetable and roadmap for opening up, China has announced a number of steps to promote market access. This speaks volume of the broad space for further economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, which would deliver great benefits to the two peoples.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe agreed to expand, exchange, and co-opt a dialogue between our two militaries at various levels realized at an earlier date the visit by U.S. Secretary of Defense to China a senior, high-level Chinese military delegation to the U.S. and work to ensure the success of the first joint staff dialogue mechanism, and the disaster management joint exercise and academic exchanges.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe agreed to strengthen law enforcement and cybersecurity cooperation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe two sides reaffirmed that neither wants to become a safe haven for each other\'s fugitives, and will instruct competent authorities of the two countries to actively explore a long-term cooperation mechanism regarding fugitive assets recovery and repatriation of illegal immigrants.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe two sides will continue the implementation of the five-point consensus reached in 2015 to enhance cybersecurity cooperation, including the use of the internet for terrorist purposes and tackling cybercrimes. We will deepen counter-narcotics cooperation and better protect each other\'s nationals and institutions in their respective countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs two distinctive countries, our two sides may have different views or differences on some issues. This is only natural. The key is to properly handle and manage them. There is far more common interests between our two countries than differences. It is important to respect each other\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity, respect each other\'s choice of development path and our difference. As long as the two sides commit to a constructive approach, we can put aside undiffused differences, while at the same time build common ground and advanced cooperation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also discussed the international responsibilities our two countries shoulder. We agreed to enhance communication and cooperation on major international, regional, and global issues, and jointly seek proper resolution of relevant (inaudible) issues to make greater contribution to peace, stability, and prosperity of relevant regions and the world at large.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, we reiterated the firm commitment to achieving denuclearization of the Peninsula and upholding international nonproliferation regime. The two sides will continue to fully and strictly implement U.N. Security Council resolutions. At the same time, the two sides commit to working toward a solution through dialogue and negotiation. And we are ready to discuss with relevant parties the pathway leading to enduring peace and stability in the Peninsula and the Northeast Asia. The two sides will maintain communication and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula issue.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe believe that China and the United States are countries with important influence in the Asia Pacific. As I said to the President, the Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the United States. The two sides need to step up communication and cooperation on Asia Pacific affairs, foster common friends, build constructive interactions, and jointly maintain and promote peace and stability and prosperity in the region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also discussed the Middle East, Afghanistan, and other issues, and agreed to deepen cooperation on counterterrorism, nonproliferation, nuclear security, and stronger support to U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe both believe that friendship between our peoples is the foundation for the sustained growth of China-U.S. relations, and we agreed to further promote people-to-people exchange. We will expand student exchange program, hold China-U.S. Young Maker Competition every year, and open additional Young Maker exchange centers in both countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLadies and gentlemen, dear friends, President Trump\'s state visit is a successful and historic visit. Together, the two of us have set out the direction and drew up the blueprint for China-U.S. relations in the common period. We will work with the United States and act on the consensus we reached, seek further progress in China-U.S. relations to bring greater benefits to our peoples and people across the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: President Xi, I want to thank you for an incredible welcoming ceremony earlier this morning. It was a truly memorable and impressive, and something I will never forget.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMelania and I are honored to visit your country, with its ancient history, dynamic people, and thriving culture. I also want to thank you and Madam Peng for a tour that was given to us yesterday of the very majestic Forbidden City. Your people are proud of who they are and what they have built together, and your people are also very proud of you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to congratulate you on the recent and very successful 19th Party Congress. Perhaps now more than ever, we have an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between our two countries and improve the lives of our citizens, as long as we stand together -- with others, if necessary -- against those who threaten our civilization. That threat will never happen. It doesn\'t even have a chance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs I said in my address yesterday in Seoul, the entire civilized world must unite to confront the North Korean menace. And the entire world is watching us right now.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, President Xi -- we discussed our mutual commitment to the complete denuclearization of North Korea. We agreed not to replicate failed approaches of the past -- and there were many. We agreed on the need to fully implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea and to increase economic pressure until North Korea abandons its reckless and dangerous path.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAll responsible nations must join together to stop arming and financing -- and even trading with -- the murderous North Korean regime. Together, we have in our power to finally liberate this region and the world from this very serious nuclear menace. But it will require collective action, collective strength, and collective devotion to winning the peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn order to create a more secure future for all and to protect our citizens from extremism and terrorism, President Xi and I also committed to working toward a peaceful future for Afghanistan. Terrorists are a threat to all of humanity, and we will stop radical Islamic terrorism.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States and China also face many challenges within our borders. Every year, drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives. Today, President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities. A special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomena: fentanyl -- destroying lives by the millions. We\'re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the President and myself.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn addition to improving the safety and security of our citizens, President Xi and I discussed improving our economic relationship. We want a vibrant trade relationship with China. We also want a fair and reciprocal one. Today, I discussed with President Xi the chronic imbalance in our relationship as it pertains to trade, and the concrete steps that we\'ll jointly take to solve the problem of the massive trade distortion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis includes addressing China\\u2019s market access restrictions and technology transfer requirements, which prevent American companies from being able to fairly compete within China. The United States is committed to protecting the intellectual property of our companies and providing a level playing field for our workers. At the same time, our relationship with you and China is a very important one to me and to all of the people of our country. And just by looking at the tremendous, incredible, job-producing agreements just signed by those major companies, we\'re off to a very, very good start.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs part of our commitment to regional stability and peace, the United States also continues to advocate for reforms that advance economic freedom, individual rights, and the rule of law.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States, working with China and other regional partners, has an incredible opportunity to advance the cause of peace, security, and prosperity all across the world. It\'s a very special time, and we do indeed have that very, very special opportunity. A great responsibility has been placed on our shoulders, President -- it\'s truly a great responsibility -- and I hope we can rise to the occasion and help our countries and our citizens reach their highest destinies and their fullest potentials.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to thank you again -- you\'re a very special man -- for your gracious hospitality. I send my warmest regards to your citizens. I honor their heritage and celebrate their great, great possibilities and potential for the future.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the coming months and years, I look forward to building an even stronger relationship between our two countries -- China and the United States of America -- and even closer friendships and relationships between the people of our countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. President, thank you very much.

ICT</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: What an honor it is to be here in Vietnam -- in the very heart of the Indo-Pacific -- to address the people and business leaders of this region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis has already been a remarkable week for the United States in this wonderful part of the world. Starting from Hawaii, Melania and I traveled to Japan, South Korea, and China, and now to Vietnam, to be here with all of you today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBefore we begin, I want to address all those affected by Typhoon Damrey. Americans are praying for you and for your recovery in the months ahead. Our hearts are united with the Vietnamese people suffering in the aftermath of this terrible storm.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis trip comes at an exciting time for America. A new optimism has swept all across our country. Economic growth has reached 3.2 percent, and going higher. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 17 years. The stock market is at an all-time high. And the whole world is lifted by America\\u2019s renewal.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEverywhere I\\u2019ve traveled on this journey, I\\u2019ve had the pleasure of sharing the good news from America. But even more, I\'ve had the honor of sharing our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific -- a place where sovereign and independent nations, with diverse cultures and many different dreams, can all prosper side-by-side, and thrive in freedom and in peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI am so thrilled to be here today at APEC, because this organization was founded to help achieve that very purpose. America stands as a proud member of the community of nations who make a home on the Pacific. We have been an active partner in this region since we first won independence ourselves.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1784, the first American ship sailed to China from the newly independent United States. It went loaded with goods to sell in Asia, and it came back full of porcelain and tea. Our first president, George Washington himself, owned a set of tableware from that ship.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1804, Thomas Jefferson sent the explorers, Lewis and Clark, on an expedition to our Pacific Coast. They were the first of the millions of Americans who ventured west to live out America\\u2019s manifest destiny across our vast continent.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1817, our Congress approved the first full-time Pacific development [deployment] of an American warship. That initial naval presence soon grew into a squadron, and then a fleet, to guarantee freedom of navigation for the growing number of ships, braving the high seas to reach markets in the Philippines, Singapore, and in India.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn 1818, we began our relationship with the Kingdom of Thailand, and 15 years later our two countries signed a treaty of friendship and commerce -- our first with an Asian nation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the next century, when imperialist powers threatened this region, the United States pushed back at great cost to ourselves. We understood that security and prosperity depended on it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe have been friends, partners, and allies in the Indo-Pacific for a long, long time, and we will be friends, partners, and allies for a long time to come.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs old friends in the region, no one has been more delighted than America to witness, to help, and to share in the extraordinary progress you have made over the last half-century.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat the countries and economies represented here today have built in this part of the world is nothing short of miraculous. The story of this region in recent decades is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFew would have imagined just a generation ago that leaders of these nations would come together here in Da Nang to deepen our friendships, expand our partnerships, and celebrate the amazing achievements of our people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis city was once home to an American military base, in a country where many Americans and Vietnamese lost their lives in a very bloody war.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, we are no longer enemies; we are friends. And this port city is bustling with ships from around the world. Engineering marvels, like the Dragon Bridge, welcome the millions who come to visit Da Nang\\u2019s stunning beaches, shining lights, and ancient charms.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the early 1990s, nearly half of Vietnam survived on just a few dollars a day, and one in four did not have any electricity. Today, an opening Vietnamese economy is one of the fastest-growing economies on Earth. It has already increased more than 30 times over, and the Vietnamese students rank among the best students in the world. (Applause.) And that is very impressive.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis is the same story of incredible transformation that we have seen across the region. Indonesians for decades have been building domestic and democratic institutions to govern their vast chain of more than 13,000 islands. Since the 1990s, Indonesia\\u2019s people have lifted themselves from poverty to become one of the fastest-growing nations of the G20. Today, it is the third-largest democracy on Earth.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Philippines has emerged as a proud nation of strong and devout families. For 11 consecutive years, the World Economic Forum has ranked the Philippines first among Asian countries in closing the gender gap and embracing women leaders in business and in politics. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tKingdom of Thailand has become an upper middle-income country in less than a generation. Its majestic capital of Bangkok is now the most visited city on Earth. And that is very impressive. Not too many people here are from Thailand. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMalaysia has rapidly developed through recent decades, and it is now ranked as one of the best places in the world to do business.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn Singapore, citizens born to parents who survived on $500 dollars a day [year] are now among the highest earners in the world -- a transformation made possible by the vision of Lee Kwan Yew\\u2019s vision of honest governance and the rule of law. (Applause.) And his great son is now doing an amazing job.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs I recently observed in South Korea, the people of that Republic took a poor country ravaged by war, and in just a few decades turned it into one of the wealthiest democracies on Earth. Today, South Koreans enjoy higher incomes than the citizens of many European Union countries. It was great spending time with President Moon.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEveryone knows of China\\u2019s impressive achievements over the past several decades. During this period -- and it was a period of great market reforms -- large parts of China experienced rapid economic growth, jobs boomed, and more than 800 million citizens rose out of poverty. I just left China this morning and had a really productive meeting and a wonderful time with our gracious host, President Xi.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd, as I saw on my first stop of this trip, in Japan we see a dynamic democracy in a land of industrial, technological, and cultural wonders. In fewer than 60 years, that island nation has produced 24 Nobel Prize winners for achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and the promotion of peace. (Applause.) President Abe and I agree on so much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the broader region, countries outside of APEC are also making great strides in this new chapter for the Indo-Pacific.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIndia is celebrating the 70th anniversary of its independence. It is a sovereign democracy, as well as -- think of this -- over 1 billion people. It\'s the largest democracy in the world. (Applause.) Since India opened its economy, it has achieved astounding growth and a new world of opportunity for its expanding middle class. And Prime Minister Modi has been working to bring that vast country, and all of its people, together as one. And he is working at it very, very successfully, indeed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we can see, in more and more places throughout this region, citizens of sovereign and independent nations have taken greater control of their destinies and unlocked the potential of their people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThey\\u2019ve pursued visions of justice and accountability, promoted private property and the rule of law, and embraced systems that value hard work and individual enterprise.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThey built businesses, they built cities, they built entire countries from the ground up. Many of you in this room have taken part in these great, uplifting national projects of building. They have been your projects from inception to completion, from dreams to reality.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith your help, this entire region has emerged -- and it is still emerging -- as a beautiful constellation of nations, each its own bright star, satellites to none -- and each one, a people, a culture, a way of life, and a home.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThose of you who have lived through these transformations understand better than anyone the value of what you have achieved. You also understand that your home is your legacy, and you must always protect it.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn the process of your economic development, you\\u2019ve sought commerce and trade with other nations, and forged partnerships based on mutual respect and directed toward mutual gain.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, I am here to offer a renewed partnership with America to work together to strengthen the bonds of friendship and commerce between all of the nations of the Indo-Pacific, and together, to promote our prosperity and security.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAt the core of this partnership, we seek robust trade relationships rooted in the principles of fairness and reciprocity. When the United States enters into a trading relationship with other countries or other peoples, we will, from now on, expect that our partners will faithfully follow the rules just like we do. We expect that markets will be open to an equal degree on both sides, and that private industry, not government planners, will direct investment.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnfortunately, for too long and in too many places, the opposite has happened. For many years, the United States systematically opened our economy with few conditions. We lowered or ended tariffs, reduced trade barriers, and allowed foreign goods to flow freely into our country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut while we lowered market barriers, other countries didn\\u2019t open their markets to us.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Funny. They must have been one of the beneficiaries. (Applause.) What country do you come from, sir?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tCountries were embraced by the World Trade Organization, even if they did not abide by its stated principles. Simply put, we have not been treated fairly by the World Trade Organization. Organizations like the WTO can only function properly when all members follow the rules and respect the sovereign rights of every member. We cannot achieve open markets if we do not ensure fair market access. In the end, unfair trade undermines us all.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States promoted private enterprise, innovation, and industry. Other countries used government-run industrial planning and state-owned enterprises.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe adhered to WTO principles on protecting intellectual property and ensuring fair and equal market access. They engaged in product dumping, subsidized goods, currency manipulation, and predatory industrial policies.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThey ignored the rules to gain advantage over those who followed the rules, causing enormous distortions in commerce and threatening the foundations of international trade itself.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSuch practices, along with our collective failure to respond to them, hurt many people in our country and also in other countries. Jobs, factories, and industries were stripped out of the United States and out of many countries in addition. And many opportunities for mutually beneficial investments were lost because people could not trust the system.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe can no longer tolerate these chronic trade abuses, and we will not tolerate them. Despite years of broken promises, we were told that someday soon everyone would behave fairly and responsibly. People in America and throughout the Indo-Pacific region have waited for that day to come. But it never has, and that is why I am here today -- to speak frankly about our challenges and work toward a brighter future for all of us.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI recently had an excellent trip to China, where I spoke openly and directly with President Xi about China\\u2019s unfair trade practices and the enormous trade deficits they have produced with the United States. I expressed our strong desire to work with China to achieve a trading relationship that is conducted on a truly fair and equal basis.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe current trade imbalance is not acceptable. I do not blame China or any other country, of which there are many, for taking advantage of the United States on trade. If their representatives are able to get away with it, they are just doing their jobs. I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it. They did not, but I will.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom this day forward, we will compete on a fair and equal basis. We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore. I am always going to put America first the same way that I expect all of you in this room to put your countries first. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States is prepared to work with each of the leaders in this room today to achieve mutually beneficial commerce that is in the interest of both your countries and mine. That is the message I am here to deliver.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI will make bilateral trade agreements with any Indo-Pacific nation that wants to be our partner and that will abide by the principles of fair and reciprocal trade. What we will no longer do is enter into large agreements that tie our hands, surrender our sovereignty, and make meaningful enforcement practically impossible.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tInstead, we will deal on a basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. We will respect your independence and your sovereignty. We want you to be strong, prosperous, and self-reliant, rooted in your history, and branching out toward the future. That is how we will thrive and grow together, in partnerships of real and lasting value.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut for this -- and I call it the Indo-Pacific dream -- if it\'s going to be realized, we must ensure that all play by the rules, which they do not right now. Those who do will be our closest economic partners. Those who do not can be certain that the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating, or economic aggression. Those days are over.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will no longer tolerate the audacious theft of intellectual property. We will confront the destructive practices of forcing businesses to surrender their technology to the state, and forcing them into joint ventures in exchange for market access.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will address the massive subsidizing of industries through colossal state-owned enterprises that put private competitors out of business -- happening all the time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will not remain silent as American companies are targeted by state-affiliated actors for economic gain, whether through cyberattacks, corporate espionage, or other anti-competitive practices. We will encourage all nations to speak out loudly when the principles of fairness and reciprocity are violated.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe know it is in America\\u2019s interests to have partners throughout this region that are thriving, prosperous, and dependent on no one. We will not make decisions for the purpose of power or patronage. We will never ask our partners to surrender their sovereignty, privacy, and intellectual property, or to limit contracts to state-owned suppliers.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will find opportunities for our private sector to work with yours and to create jobs and wealth for us all. We seek strong partners, not weak partners. We seek strong neighbors, not weak neighbors. Above all, we seek friendship, and we don\\u2019t dream of domination.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor this reason, we are also refocusing our existing development efforts. We are calling on the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to direct their efforts toward high-quality infrastructure investment that promotes economic growth.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States will also do its part. We are also committed to reforming our development finance institutions so that they better incentivize private sector investment in your economies, and provide strong alternatives to state-directed initiatives that come with many strings attached.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States has been reminded time and time again in recent years that economic security is not merely related to national security. Economic security is national security. It is vital -- (applause) -- to our national strength.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also know that we will not have lasting prosperity if we do not confront grave threats to security, sovereignty, and stability facing our world today.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEarlier this week, I addressed the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea and urged every responsible nation to stand united in declaring that every single step the North Korean regime takes toward more weapons is a step it takes into greater and greater danger. The future of this region and its beautiful people must not be held hostage to a dictator\\u2019s twisted fantasies of violent conquest and nuclear blackmail.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn addition, we must uphold principles that have benefitted all of us, like respect for the rule of law -- (applause) -- individual rights, and freedom of navigation and overflight, including open shipping lanes. Three principles and these principles -- (applause) -- create stability and build trust, security, and prosperity among like-minded nations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe must also deal decisively with other threats to our security and the future of our children, such as criminal cartels, human smuggling, drugs, corruption, cybercrime, and territorial expansion. As I have said many times before: All civilized people must come together to drive out terrorists and extremists from our societies, stripping them of funding, territory, and ideological support. We must stop radical Islamic terrorism.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo let us work together for a peaceful, prosperous, and free Indo-Pacific. I am confident that, together, every problem we have spoken about today can be solved and every challenge we face can be overcome.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf we succeed in this effort, if we seize the opportunities before us and ground our partnerships firmly in the interests of our own people, then together we will achieve everything we dream for our nations and for our children.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will be blessed with a world of strong, sovereign, and independent nations, thriving in peace and commerce with others. They will be places where we can build our homes and where families, businesses, and people can flourish and grow.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIf we do this, will we look at the globe half a century from now, and we will marvel at the beautiful constellation of nations -- each different, each unique, and each shining brightly and proudly throughout this region of the world. And just as when we look at the stars in the night sky, the distance of time will make most of the challenges we have and that we spoke of today seem very, very small.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhat will not seem small -- what is not small -- will be the big choices that all of our nations will have to make to keep their stars glowing very, very brightly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn America, like every nation that has won and defended its sovereignty, we understand that we have nothing so precious as our birthright, our treasured independence, and our freedom.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat knowledge has guided us throughout American history. It has inspired us to sacrifice and innovate. And it is why today, hundreds of years after our victory in the American Revolution, we still remember the words of an American founder and our second President of the United States, John Adams. As an old man, just before his death, this great patriot was asked to offer his thoughts on the 50th anniversary of glorious American freedom. He replied with the words: independence forever.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s a sentiment that burns in the heart of every patriot and every nation. Our hosts here in Vietnam have known this sentiment not just for 200 years, but for nearly 2,000 years. (Applause.) It was around 40 AD when two Vietnamese sisters, the Trung Sisters, first awakened the spirit of the people of this land. It was then that, for the first time, the people of Vietnam stood for your independence and your pride.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, the patriots and heroes -- (applause) -- of our histories hold the answers to the great questions of our future and our time. They remind us of who we are and what we are called to do.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether, we have it in our power to lift our people and our world to new heights -- heights that have never been attained,</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo let us choose a future of patriotism, prosperity, and pride. Let us choose wealth and freedom over poverty and servitude. Let us choose a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFinally, let us never forget the world has many places -- (applause) -- many dreams, and many roads. But in all of the world, there is no place like home.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tso, for family, for country, for freedom, for history, and for the glory of God, protect your home, defend your home, and love your home today and for all time. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. God Bless You. God Bless the Pacific region. And God Bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Just have a good time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMelania and I also want to extend a special thanks to Ambassador Bill Hagerty, who\'s doing an outstanding job. He\'s an outstanding person. I know him very well. Believe me, you got one of the great ones. He\'s leading our American embassy in Tokyo.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI\'m honored to be here today in this beautiful country, home of the extraordinary people of Japan. Japan is a treasured partner and crucial ally of the United States. And today we thank them for welcoming us and for decades of wonderful friendship between our two nations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAmericans have deep respect and admiration for the people of Japan -- their amazing culture, their strong spirit, and their very proud history.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo on behalf of the United States of America, I send the warmest wishes of the American people to the citizens of this remarkable country. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tnow I know how you guys feel. This is pretty good. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\ttravels across Asia will take us to many historic places to see many wonderful sights, and to speak before many audiences. But there is no single place I\\u2019d rather begin my trip than right here, with all of you -- the incredible men and women of the United States military -- and your amazing partners, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. Thank you for being here. Thank you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTo everyone here today who serves your country in uniform: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We salute you -- (laughter) -- what\'s your rank? (Laughter.) We\'re going to raise it. (Applause.) We salute you, we honor you, and we stand proudly with the men and women who defend us and our way of life. Nations are built from the courage, love, and sacrifice of patriots just like you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tEach of you inherits the proud legacy of generations of warriors that have walked these very grounds for more than seven decades.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFrom Yokota\\u2019s runways, American pilots took to the air and drove back the invaders during the Korean War. Tremendous courage. Tremendous bravery. From here, they enforced a precious peace during a long and bitter Cold War. And in the aftermath of the devastating 2011 tsunami, this base served as the launching point for Operation Tomodachi -- the largest humanitarian relief effort in American history, which saved the lives of thousands and thousands of great Japanese citizens.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLike those who came before you, you always rise to the occasion, and you never, ever let your country down.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tGeneral Martinez, General Chiarotti, General Pasquarette, Rear Admiral Fenton, Brigadier General Winkler, Colonel Moss, and Chief Master Sergeant Greene: You lead the forces under your command with exceptional skill and devotion, and America is tremendously grateful to you. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re also fortunate to stand alongside such strong and capable allies. General Maehera, General Asai, General Imaki, and General Ando: Thank you for your leadership and service. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn behalf of the American people, I want each and every one of you, both American and Japanese, to know that your service and commitment helps keep us all safe, strong, and free.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also want to express our gratitude to the family members and loved ones who sacrifice so much to make your service possible. They are absolutely incredible people, and it\'s not easy. America is profoundly grateful for all you do.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we are, back home, starting to do -- I will tell you, and you\'re reading and you\'re seeing -- really, really well. The stock market is at an all-time high. (Applause.) Unemployment, back in the United States, is at a 17-year low. (Applause.) Almost 2 million jobs have been added since a very, very special day; it\'s called Election Day, November 8th. Two million jobs. (Applause.) It\'s a lot of jobs.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we\'ve dealt ISIS one brutal defeat after another. And it\'s about time. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt\'s truly inspiring to see American airmen and Marines and -- (applause) -- you know, I have a great Marine here: General Kelly, four-star. Did anyone ever hear of General Kelly? Where\'s General Kelly? (Applause.) He is something. Now he\'s Chief of Staff. But he does like those four stars, I want to tell you that. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut American airmen and the Marines and Japanese Self-Defense Forces that are standing here with us today, side-by-side, confident, committed, and more capable than ever. You instill confidence in the hearts of our allies, and you strike fear in the hearts of our enemies. It\'s the way it should be, isn\'t it? (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur alliance is a testament to the transformative power of freedom. Today, nations that once waged war now stand together as friends and partners in pursuit of a much better world. And we\'re getting there. We\'re getting there faster than you think.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith your presence here today, shoulder-to-shoulder, you put hope into every soul that yearns for peace. All of you have made Yokota one of the most capable operational bases in Japan and, actually, anywhere in the world. For over a decade, this incredible place has been home not only to American servicemembers, but also to the Air Defense Command of the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force. Today, this base serves as a critical center for coordination for American and Japanese commanders to plan their missions.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor almost 60 years, the military alliance we see on this base has endured -- a cornerstone of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for our nations, this region, and indeed the entire world. Today, we pay tribute to that legacy -- a legacy you protect and grow each and every day.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe dominate the sky, we dominate the sea, we dominate the land and space -- (applause) -- not merely because we have the best equipment, which we do -- and, by the way, a lot of it\'s coming in; you saw that budget. That\'s a lot different than in the past. A lot of beautiful, brand new equipment is coming in. And nobody makes it like they make it in the United States. Nobody. (Applause.) Got a lot of stuff coming. Use it well.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut because we have -- more important than equipment, we have the best people. Each of you embodies the warrior creed. Your devotion, prowess, and expertise make you the most fearsome fighting force in the history of our world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTogether with our allies, America\\u2019s warriors are prepared to defend our nation using the full range of our unmatched capabilities. No one -- no dictator, no regime, and no nation -- should underestimate, ever, American resolve. Every once in a while, in the past, they underestimated us. It was not pleasant for them, was it? (Applause.) It was not pleasant.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will never yield, never waver, and never falter in defense of our people, our freedom, and our great American flag. (Applause.) That flag stands for the values of our Republic, the history of our people, the sacrifice of our heroes, and our loyalty to the nation we love.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs long as I am President, the servicemen and women who defend our nation will have the equipment, the resources, and the funding they need to secure our homeland, to respond to our enemies quickly and decisively, and, when necessary, to fight, to overpower, and to always, always, always win. Right? (Applause.) This is the heritage of the American Armed Forces -- the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFree nations must be strong nations, and we welcome it when our allies -- from Europe to Asia -- renew their commitment to peace through strength. We seek peace and stability for the nations of the world, including those right here in this region. And it\'s a great region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs Americans celebrate Veterans Day this month, we honor all who have sacrificed to make peace and stability possible. We pay tribute to every proud American who has worn the uniform and served our country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, many nations of the Indo-Pacific are thriving because of the sacrifices made by American servicemembers and our allies, and because of the sacrifices all of you continue to make each and every day.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHere in Japan, we have seen the amazing things that are possible when a people are free and independent. Over the course of a single lifetime, the Japanese people have built one of the most successful societies and nations in the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOver the next 10 days, we travel to South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. We will seek new opportunities for cooperation and commerce, and we will partner with friends and allies to pursue a free and open Indo-Pacific Region. We will seek free, fair, and reciprocal trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut this future is only within our grasp because of you. You make it possible for peace-loving nations to thrive and for peace-loving people to prosper.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou are the reason the great American flag will proudly stand behind me wherever I go. And every time I look at that flag, I will think of brave men and women like you, and I will think of all the American patriots, down through the generations, who poured out their blood, sweat, tears, hopes, and dreams to defend our country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhen you follow your citizens and people across the Indo-Pacific region -- see the flags of free and sovereign states, like the United States and Japan, displayed during our diplomatic meetings over the next 10 days, be proud of your nation, be proud of your service, and be proud of the security you provide that makes it all possible.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tLike your predecessors, you -- our brave warriors -- are the last bulwark against threats to the dreams of people in America and Japan, and all across the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou are the greatest hope for people who desire to live in freedom and harmony, and you are the greatest threat to tyrants and dictators who seek to prey on the innocent.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tHistory has proven over and over that the road of the tyrant is a steady march toward poverty, suffering, and servitude. But the path of strong nations and free people, certain of their values and confident in their futures, is a proven path toward prosperity and peace. We cherish our cultures, we embrace our values, and we always fight for what we believe in.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBecause of you, the people of America, the people of Japan, and the freedom-loving people everywhere are able to fulfill their destinies and follow their dreams. And we are grateful for your families, for their sacrifice and support that allows our brave men and women to serve. We also appreciate the sacrifice of dedicated civilians who keep this base going and take care of our military and their precious loved ones.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe are eternally grateful for your service and for your sacrifice. And we are forever in your debt.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI am so proud to be here with you today. We face many challenges and many opportunities, and we will face all of them together as a team. And if we do, I am certain that the future for America, for Japan, and for our cherished allies has never, ever looked brighter. Because of patriots like you, freedom will prevail.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you. God bless you. God bless the Armed Forces. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you. Thank you all.

EST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMR. MACDONALD: Thank you, Honorable President of this great United States of America, President Trump. Thank you for inviting us, Navajo Code Talkers, to the Capitol and to the White House of this great nation we call the United States.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tToday, we have with us three of the thirteen surviving Navajo Code Talkers of World War II. First, we have Fleming Begaye. Fleming Begaye is 97 years old, the oldest veteran of World War II. He survived the Battle of Tarawa. His landing craft was blown up and he literally had to swim to the beach to survive. Also, on Saipan, he also landed on Tinian where he got shot up real badly, survived one year in naval hospital.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe have Thomas Begay, also one of the Code Talkers who were on Iwo Jima, a tough battle, where Three Marine Division landed on Iwo; 5th Marine Division -- he was part of the Code Talkers within the 5th Marine Division.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlso, as if Marine Corps was not enough, he enlisted to be United States Army, and served in the Korean War. Survived that awful battle at Chosin.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMy name is Peter MacDonald. I\'m the president of the 13 surviving Navajo Code Talkers. I went in -- I\'m 90 years old -- I went in when I was 15 years old in 1944. I was with the 1st Marine Brigade on Guam, and then went on to North China with 6th Marine Division to get those Japanese in Northern China to surrender. They didn\\u2019t want to surrender, but it took 1st Marine Division, 6th Marine Division to get them to surrender eventually. We had a separate treaty ceremony in Tsingtao, China, October 25th, 1945.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNavajo Code Talkers, in the early part of World War II, the enemy was breaking every military code that was being used in the Pacific. This created a huge problem for strategizing against the enemy. Eventually, a suggestion was made in early 1942 -- February \'42, essentially -- to use Navajo language as a code.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe Marine Corps recruited 29 young Navajos, not telling them what they are being recruited for, because this was a top-secret operation. They were just asked, "Do you want to join the Marines? You want to fight the enemy? Come join the Marines." So they volunteered.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTwenty-nine young Navajos joined the Marines in 1942, after going through boot camp, passed boot camp with flying colors; combat training -- the same thing. Then entered the Marine Corps Communication School -- passed that. Then they were separated from all the rest of the Marines, took them to a top-secret location just east of San Diego -- Camp Elliott. That\'s where they created a military code to be used in the Pacific.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAfter creating 260 code words, the 29 young Marines -- half of them were sent overseas to join the 1st Marine Division. The 1st Marine Division was getting ready to go on to the first offensive movement in the Pacific, Guadalcanal.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn August 7, 1942 -- 75 years ago -- 1st Marine Division hit the beaches of Guadalcanal with 15 Navajo Code Talkers. This was the first battle where the Navajo code was to be tested in actual battle to test to see how our memory would be under heavy enemy fire. Well, three weeks after the landing, General Van De Griff, Commander of the 1st Marine Division, sent word back to United States saying, this Navajo code is terrific. The enemy never understood it; he said, we don\'t understand it either, but it works. Send us some more Navajos.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo that opened up the gate for United States Marine Corps, San Diego to start recruiting more and more Navajos, using the same tactics: "You want to fight? You want to join the Marines? You want to wear this beautiful blue uniform? Come join the Marines." So we all volunteered. That\'s how he went in, that\'s how he went in, that\'s how I went in.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBoot camp, combat training, communication schools. Then we all get separated, go to that special top-secret Navajo code school to learn to code. Initially, 260 code words, all subject to memory only. Eventually, by the time the war ended, 1945, there were 400 of us that went to war. And also, our code words grew to 600 code words, subject to memory only. In every battle two communication networks were established: Navajo communication network for all top-secret, confidential messages; the second network, English network, for all other messages.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn every battle -- from the frontline, beach command post, command ship, all other ships -- Code Talkers were used. On the island of Iwo, Major Connor said, the first 48 hours of battle, over 800 messages were sent by the 5th Marine Division, only. The first 48 hours, over 800 messages. Major Connor also said: Without Navajo, Marines would never have taken the island of Iwo Jima. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo thank you very much. The 13 of us, we still have one mission -- that mission is to build national Navajo Code Talker Museum. We want to preserve this unique World War II history for our children, grandchildren, your children, your grandchildren to go through that museum.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWhy? Because what we did truly represents who we are as Americans. America, we know, is composed of diverse community. We have different languages, different skills, different talents, and different religion. But when our way of life is threatened, like the freedom and liberty that we all cherish, we come together as one. And when we come together as one, we are invincible. We cannot be defeated. That\'s why we need this national Navajo Code Talker Museum so that our children, the future generation, can go through that museum and learn why America is so strong.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much for listening. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: That\'s fantastic, thank you. That\'s fantastic. Thank you very much. Beautiful.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat was so incredible, and now I don\'t have to make my speech. I had the most beautiful speech written out. I was so proud of it. Look. And I thought you would leave out Iwo Jima, but you got that in the end, too. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I want to tell you -- you said you\'re 90 years old? That\'s great, because you have good genes. That means the press has got me to kick around for a long time. (Laughter.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThat was beautiful. I loved that and I loved your delivery. And the Code Talkers are amazing. And seriously, it is what I said. So what I\'m going to do is give you my speech, and I want you to hold that. And I know you like me, so you\'ll save it. But that was so well delivered, from the heart. That was from the heart.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I want to give you this speech because I don\'t want to bore them with saying the same thing you just said. And you said it better, believe me, because you said it from here. And I mean it from there too.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd you have a lot of great friends. Tom Cole is here, and you know Tom. And you know Jeff. So I want to thank you both, Jeff Denham. I want to thank you both for being here, and you too for being here.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlso, General Dunford, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Kelly. And I have to say, I said to General Kelly --- I said, General, how good -- here he is right there, the Chief; he\'s the General and the Chief. I said, how good were these Code Talkers? What was it? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were -- what they\'ve done for this country, and the strength and the bravery and the love that they had for the country and that you have for the country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance. And I just want to thank you because you\'re very, very special people. You were here long before any of us were here, although we have a representative in Congress who, they say, was here a long time ago. They call her "Pocahontas."</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut you know what, I like you because you are special. You are special people. You are really incredible people. And from the heart, from the absolute heart, we appreciate what you\'ve done, how you\'ve done it, the bravery that you displayed, and the love that you have for your country.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTom, I would say that\'s as good as it gets, wouldn\'t you say? That\'s as good as you get.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tGeneral Kelly, just come up for one second. I want to just have you say what you told me, a little bit about the Code Talkers. Because it really has been -- learning about you and learning about what you\'ve done has been something that I\'d like General Kelly to say to the press.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tGo ahead, General.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tGENERAL KELLY: Well, sir, as you know, being associated with United States Marines, it\'s as much a cult as it is a service. And we never forget. Our motto, of course, is Semper Fidelis -- always faithful. Whether you\'re a young recruit at Parris Island or San Diego, or a middle-aged guy from out west, what these men did, the advantage they gave our Marines when they invaded Iwo Jima was really -- and I think it was pointed out -- was one of the very few factors that allowed us to be successful on that island.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTheir ability to outwit the Japanese who were, you know, listening to this wonderful language and had no idea that a language like this existed on the Earth. What they did, very small number of men, sir, made the difference. We lost 6,000 Marines and 25,000 wounded on that island in 28 days of battle. It would have been a lot worse had we not had the Navajo Code Talkers. And I thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSemper Fidelis. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: So they\'re working on building a Navajo Code Talkers Museum. And we will help you. Okay? And we have some pretty good strength. We will help you, and you deserve it. And I want to thank you all for being here.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI assume you\'re the young one in the group? Are you the young one in the group? Thank you so much for being here. You\'re very special people. And without you, maybe the results would have been a lot different. I\'ve heard that, actually, the results could have very well been different.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo, on behalf of the United States, thank you all. Very much appreciate it. (Applause.)</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMR. MACDONALD: Mr. President, we know you\'ll succeed. America is in good hands. You have all top Marine Corps generals as your assistants -- (laughter) -- so we know that we\'re in good hands. (Applause).</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: What a group. This is a great group. Thank you all very much. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ What about the tax bill?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: I think the tax bill is going very well. We had a meeting on it today. It\'s going to be a tremendous tax cut -- the biggest in the history of our country. You\'ll have to pay a lot less tax. That\'s okay. But we\'re going to have a tremendous -- I think we\'re going to have great receptivity.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'ve had great spirit. And I will tell you the Republican senators were up. If we win, we\'ll get some Democratic senators joining us. If we don\'t win, they won\'t be joining us -- you understand that. But, if we win, I think we\'ll probably have a bipartisan bill, meaning a number of people are going to come over. But I\'m not so interested in that. We\'re really interested just in getting it passed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAgain, it will be the biggest tax reduction in the history of our country. It will bring jobs, it will bring a lot of income coming into the country, buying product, et cetera. And, I think it\'s doing very well.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Is there a worry, though, that it benefits hedge fund owners during (inaudible) --</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTHE PRESIDENT: No, I think we\'re going to have really -- I think -- actually, I think it\'s going to benefit everybody. It\'s going to mostly benefit people looking for jobs more than anything else, because we\'re giving great incentives.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we\'re going to be bringing back into this country probably an excess of $4 trillion -- $4 trillion -- that\'s outside of the country that right now, because of our tax laws, can\'t come back in. And we will be bringing back at least -- I think the number will be substantially higher -- but at least $4 trillion, which will immediately be put to work in this country. So I think the tax bill is doing very well and I think the Republicans are going to be very proud of it. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t2:43 P.M.

JST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Ladies and gentlemen, at the outset, may I begin by offering my condolence to the victims who lost their lives, as well as my sympathy to the people injured in the recent shooting incidents in Texas. I\'d like to express my heartfelt solidarity to the people of the United States in this time of difficulty.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt was only one year ago -- November, last year -- that I met the President for the first time in the Trump Tower New York. Since then, I have had numerous opportunities to converse with the President on the margin of international meetings as well as countless talks on the phone. Indeed, how many hours of dialogue did we have? I believe that there has never been such close bonds intimately connecting the leaders of both nations as we do now in the history of Japan-U.S. alliance of more than half a century.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn particular, he received me with great hospitality last February on my visit to the U.S. at his villa in Florida. It became my unforgettable memory that we were able to discuss a variety of global issues over so many hours, quite frankly including several rounds of golf.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd it is my particular delight that this time I\'m able to welcome my dear friend, President Trump, and Madam Melania Trump, to Japan. This first trip of President Trump to Asia is a historic visit in the current regional situation, which is ever more tense. And his first nation to visit on his tour is Japan. This made this historic significance even greater.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIn this way, two of us were able to show to the rest of the world the unshakable Japan-U.S. alliance. Thank you, Donald.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor the last two days, I was able to have an in-depth discussion with Donald on a plethora of issues that the international community is faced with. In the discussion, overwhelming importance was occupied by the North Korean issue. We were in complete agreement as to the measures to be taken upon the analysis of the latest situation of North Korea giving a good amount of time.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJapan consistently supports the position of President Trump when he says that all options are on the table. Through the talks over two days, I once again strongly reaffirmed that Japan and U.S. are 100 percent together.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFor more than 20-some years, the international community attempted dialogue with North Korea. At the time of framework agreement of 1994 and at the Six-Party Agreement of 2006, North Korea committed in abandoning their nuclear program. But each time, the promise was broken, which resulted in North Korea buying time for their nuclear and missile development while we were making efforts for dialogue.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThere is no point in the dialogue for the sake of dialogue with North Korea. Now is the time not for dialogue but for applying maximum level of pressure on North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe completely agreed that, in order to make North Korea change their policy, Japan and U.S. must take leadership in closely collaborating with the international community so that we can enhance the pressure to the maximum level over North Korea through all possible means.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI agree with President Trump that we welcome China strengthening her pressure over North Korea, and it is incumbent upon China to play even greater roles to let North Korea relinquish their nuclear and missile development.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe reaffirmed once again the importance of further advancing trilateral cooperation among Japan, U.S., and the Republic of Korea -- a country President Trump will visit tomorrow.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBefore this press conference, President and Mrs. Trump were good enough to meet with the members of the families of abductees. I would like to render my heartfelt gratitude for their listening so intently to what the family members had to tell them.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUntil the day when all the families of the abductees embrace their loved ones in their own arms -- until that day, my mission is not complete. I\'m sure that the families -- I have renewed my resolve to work in full force to seek the resolution of this issue. I have decided to take our own additional sanction measures in our effort to seek the solution of the nuclear missile and the most important abduction issues of North Korea.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tTomorrow, there will be a decision of freezing assets of 35 North Korean entities and individuals. Going forward, Japan and U.S. will continue to cooperation closely for the early resolution of the North Korean issue.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also discussed bilateral economic issues with President Trump. We welcomed that in the second meeting of Japan-U.S. Economic Dialogue held last month between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence. The importance of strengthening bilateral economic trade and investment relations was confirmed.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd we will go deeper into our dialogue. We agreed that we will continue our discussion in order to invigorate more the bilateral trade and investment, and enhance our cooperation in areas of law enforcement, energy, infrastructure, among others.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJapan and the U.S. are the two global economic leaders, occupying 30 percent of the global economy, sharing common values such as freedom and fairness. The significance of Japan-U.S. alliance is not limited on security front alone. In the economic field, it greatly contributes to the prosperity of the region and the world.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI, together with President Trump, shall work not only in the field of bilateral trade, but also lead in the high-standard rulemaking in trade and investment broadly in the Asia Pacific region. I am determined to see to it so that both Japan and U.S. strongly lead the regional and, eventually, the global economic growth by our cumulative efforts in creating fair and effective economic order in this region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWith the President, I discussed APEC and East Asia Summit meetings that we will going after this. Indo-Pacific region, covering the vast area of Asia Pacific through the Indian Ocean to the Middle East and Africa, is the growth center of the world, with more than half of the world population. The maintenance and enhancement of the maritime order that is free and open is critically important for the peace and prosperity of this region, and we concurred to strengthen our cooperation toward realizing free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tUnder the unwavering Japan-U.S. alliance, I shall play a leadership role for the peace and prosperity of this region, hand -in-hand with President Trump. For the last two days, I had indeed very serious discussions with President Trump. I also had an opportunity to play golf with our top pro, Hideki Matsuyama, yesterday. Indeed the match was a neck-and-neck competition, in my opinion. What was the reality? I hope that Mr. Trump will give his evaluation.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe dinner where Mrs. Trump joined was in such a truly relaxed atmosphere that we almost forgot how time flew. I am greatly very much satisfied. I hope that they enjoyed the banquet later on, by all means.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much. Thank you very much, President Trump. The floor is yours.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, thank you very much, Shinzo. And this has been a truly enjoyable trip and one where we\'re accomplishing a lot.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd I agree with you that our relationship is extraordinary. And I agree with you also that there has never been such a close relationship between the leaders of two countries -- these two countries, Japan and the United States. So it\'s been great to be with you, and we\'ll be spending a lot of time with you over the years.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMelania and I are deeply grateful for the warm welcome we\'ve received in your remarkable country. And that\'s what it is -- it is a remarkable country. This is a land of incredible history, culture, tradition, and spirit.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tFirst, let me congratulate you on your great success in the recent elections. You won very big and very easily, and I\'m not at all surprised. We both share in common, really, a deep loyalty to our citizens and a deep faith in the destiny of our people and also our people and our countries working together.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI also want to take a moment to continue sending our thoughts, prayers, and deepest condolences to the victims of the horrific assault on a church in a beautiful area -- so sad -- Sutherland Springs, Texas. Such a beautiful, wonderful area with incredible people. Who would ever think a thing like this could happen?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo I want to send my condolences, the condolences of our First Lady. In tragic times, Americans always pull together. We are always strongest when we are unified. To the wounded and the families of the victims, all of America is praying for you, supporting you, and grieving alongside of you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPrime Minister, I want to thank you and the people of Japan for your friendship. We have so many great things that we can accomplish together, and we are in the process of accomplishing those things.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tIt was a thrill for my daughter, Ivanka, to be able to participate in the World Assembly for Women and promote women entrepreneurship. Side-by-side, our two nations are advancing polices to empower women and harness the full potential of our great economies.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou were the first foreign leader to visit me shortly after my election, and now it is my pleasure to join you in your homeland to further strengthen the historic ties between our two great nations.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs you know, this is my first visit to the Indo-Pacific region as President -- been here before -- but as President, this has been my first and it is my first. And I am thrilled that my first stop was with you, great friend.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe\'re going to other countries where I have also developed some great friendships, and we\'re going to work to straighten a lot of things out, including trade, including military problems. We have a lot of things to work on. But this is a real honor to be with you, Shinzo.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tJapan is a very special place. The Japanese people are thriving, your cities are vibrant, and you\'ve built one of the world\\u2019s most powerful economies. I don\'t know if it\'s as good as ours. I think not. Okay? And we\'re going to try and keep it that way, but you\'ll be second.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd yet, for all of its modern splendor, the people of Japan maintain a profound respect for their rich culture, heritage, and traditions. Honoring the past, even as you blaze new trails into the future -- very, very strongly looking into the future -- is Japan.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou demonstrate every day that the respect for history and heritage is the true foundation for progress. Our nations share an enduring bond. America and Japan face many challenges, many opportunities. There are many things we face, but we will be facing them together, in friendship and as allies.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMost importantly, we\'re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea. The regime-continued development of its unlawful weapons programs, including its illegal nuclear test and outrageous launches of ballistic missiles directly over Japanese territory, are a threat to the civilized world and international peace and stability.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will not stand for that. The era of strategic patience is over. Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong, but look what\'s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPrime Minister Abe has also shared with me the tragic stories of Japanese young people who North Korea has abducted over the years. Together, we met with the parents of Megumi Yokota who was abducted as a young girl in 1977. No child should ever be subjected to such cruelty. No parent should ever have to endure 40 years of heartbreak.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe also had a young wonderful man in our country, Otto Warmbier. We all know the story of Otto; it\'s a horrible story, a sad story. And we can\'t let that happen. Cannot let that happen.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe United States of America stands in solidarity with the people of Japan against the North Korean menace. History has proven over and over that strong and free nations will always prevail over tyrants who oppress their people.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOur powerful and enduring U.S.-Japan alliance includes more than 50,000 members of the United States military stationed right here in Japan. In addition to that, we have 33,000 stationed in South Korea. American and Japanese military personnel train together, work together, and will stand together to defend the security and sovereignty of both of our countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI want to thank the entire Japanese people for acting as such gracious hosts and strong partners for our men and women in the armed forces.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAmerica is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan. As President of the United States, I am committed to achieving a fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan\'s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan. We\'re working on that -- something we\'ve all been working on very hard from the very beginning of our meetings.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs we continue to pursue closer economic ties, I believe it will create new and exciting opportunities to achieve greater prosperity in both of our nations and to advance new frontiers in science, medicine, and technology. The United States respects and honors Japan\'s heritage and admires your deep well of perseverance.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tI appreciate very much your acknowledging and stating the fact that the United States economy has done so well since our election on November 8th. Close to 200 million jobs. The highest stock market in our history. So many different things are happening for the better, including the cutting of massive amounts of regulation, which is one of the reasons that the market is reacting the way it\'s reacting.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThis mutual respect for culture and sovereignty will continue to bring our nations closer and closer together, and open up new avenues of cooperation and success.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMr. Prime Minister, thank you again for inviting me today and for opening the arms of your majestic country to our American delegation, all of whom are right now in this room. I look forward to working side by side with you in friendship. We will have success like rarely seen between two countries -- Japan and the United States of America, two very, very special places.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you for having us. Thank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ (As interpreted.) (Inaudible) from NHK. This is a question to Mr. Abe. Prime Minister and President Trump have agreed on maximizing the pressure toward the relinquishing of nuclear development by North Korea. Mr. Trump is going to Korea and China, and then there is going to be an APEC Leaders meeting. So, Mr. Abe, what is your idea about the significance of this bilateral summit meeting?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn the other hand, North Korea is still fixing its attitude, not responding to the relinquishing of nuclear development. What is necessary in order to avoid any accidental military confrontation?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) While Japan-U.S. alliance being the foundation of the regional peace and prosperity, precisely when Japan-U.S. partners strongly, the peace of this region becomes unshakeable. From that perspective, I consider that this time we were able to reaffirm strong bonds and ties between Japan and the United States on this opportunity of the visit of President Trump. This was quite significant for the regional peace.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tOn the North Korean situation, between President Trump and myself, we confirmed that we are together 100 percent. We will enhance the pressure that the entire international community exercises over North Korea to the maximum extent by both Japan and the United States collaborating and working toward China and Russia.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNo one likes conflicts. I don\\u2019t like it; Mr. Trump neither. But North Korea continues its provocation against the international community, so we need to collaborate in the international community so that they change their policy. We must exercise our pressure.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd from the North Korea, we will change our policy, so please come to talk to us. I think this is what is most important that we expect. And we have a complete agreement with President Trump. And together with many countries, I\'m sure that we share in the same thinking.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAlso, the free and open maritime order based upon the rule of law is a foundation of the stability and prosperity of the international community. This time around, as the first leg of his tour in Asia, President and I were able to reaffirm that both countries will make efforts looking toward the Indo-Pacific, which is free and open -- very significant. There will be APEC Leaders Meeting and EAS Summit Meeting. In these meetings, I\'d like to take leadership in driving this kind of discussion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo, free and open Indo-Pacific strategy -- if any country would agree with this strategy, with whatever country we can collaborate for the implementation of this strategy. So we will continue to have partnership between Japan and the United States so that we can contribute jointly to the peace and stability of the region.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: For the United States\' first question, we\'ll go to Steve Holland, from Reuters.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Thank you, sir. In response to the Texas shooting, what policies would you support to reduce these violent actions? Is gun control the answer?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd secondly, you spoke yesterday about the warmth of the North Korean people. What\'s your message to their leader, Kim Jong-un, as you prepare to head to South Korea tomorrow?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd if I could ask the Prime Minister a question as well: Could you respond to what the President said this morning -- that trade is not free and reciprocal with the United States? Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, as far as the North Korean people are concerned, Steve, I think that these are great people. They\'re under a very repressive regime, and I really think that, ultimately -- I can tell you this -- that I hope it all works out. It would be better for everybody. Certainly would be better for North Korea, but it would be better for everybody. So we hope that\'s going to take place.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs far as your second question, which is really the first part of your question, I think that mental health is your problem here. This was a very -- based on preliminary reports -- very deranged individual. A lot of problems over a long period of time. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut this isn\'t a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it\'s a little bit soon to go into it. But, fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it would have been -- as bad it was, it would have been much worse.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut this is a mental health problem at the highest level. It\'s a very, very sad event. These are great people, and a very, very sad event. But that\'s the way I view it. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) With President Trump, trade and economic matters -- bilateral issues -- we did discuss, on the economic matter, how U.S. and Japanese economies should be. There is dialogue going on between Mr. Aso and Mr. Pence. There were two meetings already.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo on the question of economy, together with President Trump, not only regarding bilateral trade, we would like to see the entire region of Asia Pacific -- high-standard rulemaking is something that we want to pursue. So with both countries in this region, we will make efforts to create an economic order which is fair and effective so that, regarding the both economies mutually, we would like to see the mutual development of both economies</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo in the United States, already since the start of Trump administration, partly thanks to the Japanese investment, 17,000 jobs have been created in the United States. So all countries in the world, vis-\\xe0-vis the United States, they make investment. But Japanese investment ranks, in terms of job creation. So the economic relations between the two countries may develop further, thereby creating jobs, thereby growing the economy.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo in creating both countries\' economies -- Aso-Pence Economic Dialogue Framework would be quite relevant, and we\'d like to see good outcome from that dialogue.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tWe will go back to the Japanese press for questions. Yes, please.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ I have a question to President Trump. You met with the family members of abductees and you met with Hitomi Soga, actual abductee. How can you comment on your meeting with them? To North Korea, is there a possibility of U.S. military action? Suppose that the U.S. decides to go on it, the abductees\' rescue -- how do you think about it once the military action is to be imminent?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I think it\'s very sad. I look at what\'s happened, and it\'s a very, very sad thing. Who has ever heard of anything like this? Abducted by a hostile country for purposes of language, for purposes of -- could be any number of another reasons. We\'ll see what happens in terms of the ultimate conclusion.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I did put it in my speech at the United Nations, and many people in Japan were really thrilled that I did because a lot of people thought that the folks we\'re talking about were forgotten about. Like I say, the "forgotten people" -- where they were, maybe they\'re forgotten people. But I can tell you, your great Prime Minister did not forget. He didn\'t forget at all.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo we\'ll work together and see if we can do something. Now the spotlight is on and perhaps we can have some very good luck, and perhaps the regime itself would send them back. I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong-un would send them back. If he would send them back, that would be the start of something -- I think, would be just something very special if they would do that.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut I spoke with people who were devastated, and they\'ve been devastated for many years. They think they\'re alive, but they don\'t know. Probably makes it even tougher that way. But we\'ll see what happens. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tMS. SANDERS: Thank you. The second question from the United States -- Mark Landler, New York Times.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tQ Thank you very much. My first question is to President Trump. Mr. President, you\'ve spent the last two days reaffirming the U.S.-Japan alliance, and you\'ve begun sketching out this vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific. But in two days, you\'re going to travel to China, a country that is neither free nor open. So my question is, how can the U.S. be a force for freedom and openness in this region without inevitably coming into conflict with China?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd then, to the Prime Minister. Mr. Prime Minister, the President has spoken on many occasions in the past about hoping to see the Japanese take a strong role in their own defense. He\'d like to sell Japan military equipment, and there have been press reports that the President was disappointed that the Japanese didn\'t shoot the North Korean missile out of the sky -- the one that was shot over Hokkaido. I\'m wondering, did this subject come up? And what message did you have for the President about the role you\'d like to see Japan take in its defense?</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Mark. I will say, if I could just take a piece of the Prime Minister\'s answer -- he will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States. He will easily shoot them out of the sky, just like we shot something out of the sky the other day in Saudi Arabia, as you saw. And that was a very rapidly moving missile shot out of the sky. That was a needle in the sky, and it was hit immediately and exploded without damage.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tSo one of the things, I think, that\'s very important is that the Prime Minister of Japan is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment, by far. He\'ll be purchasing it from the United States. Whether it\'s the F-35 fighter, which is the greatest in the world -- total stealth -- or whether it\'s missiles of many different kinds, it\'s a lot of jobs for us and a lot of safety for Japan and other countries that are likewise purchasing a lot of military equipment from us that, frankly, a year ago and two years ago were not.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAs far as China is concerned, my relationship, as you know, with President Xi is also excellent. I like him a lot. I consider him a friend. He considers me a friend. With that being said, he represents China; I represent the United States. His views are different on things, but they\'re pretty similar on trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThe problem we have with China is that for decades they\'ve been -- you know, it\'s been a very unfair -- let me be very kind to previous administrations -- it\'s been a very unfair trade situation. Our trade deficit is massive. It\'s hundreds of billions of dollars a year, anywhere from $350 billion to $504 billion, and that doesn\'t include intellectual property. And we\'ve already started discussions with China because it has to come down. It has to come down. And that has to do with, really, free trade, fair trade, or reciprocal trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd frankly, I like reciprocal the best of the group. Because when you explain to somebody that you\'re going to charge tariffs in order to equalize, or you\'re going to do other things -- some people that don\'t get it, they don\'t like to hear that. But when you say it\'s going to be reciprocal -- that we\'re going to charge the same as they\'re charging us -- the people that don\'t want a 5 percent or a 10 percent tariff say, oh, reciprocal is fair -- and that could be 100 percent. So it\'s much more, Mark, understandable when you talk about reciprocal.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tAnd reciprocal trade is very important to me. We have many countries, not just China or Japan, or so many others that we see. I mean, we have one country that charges us 100 percent tax if we sell things into that country, and yet when they sell the same product into our country, we charge them nothing. Now, I\'ve been against that for a long time, and you will be seeing, we do things about it</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, it also takes a period of time to do that, because, as you know, you have statutory limitations in time. You have to put out notices. You have to wait 90 days before you can put out the next, and then you have to wait another 120 days, and then a 30-day. Now, much of this has already been caught and caught up. Some of it was unnecessary, statutorily.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tBut you will be seeing things of countries that have been treating the United States and the United States worker and companies -- because I view the companies not as a company, I view it as an extension of the worker -- but that have been treating our companies, our country, and our workers very unfairly.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tYou will be seeing that the United States will take very, very strong action. It\'s already started, but most of the legal foundation has now been done. And you\'re going to see a very big difference, and it\'s going to happen very soon. Because the United States, by many countries, has been treated very, very unfairly when it comes to trade.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tPRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Regarding Japan defense equipment, a lot of them we purchase from the United States. The North Korean situation becoming very tough; the Asia Pacific security situation becoming very tough. We qualitatively and quantitatively, we have to enhance our defense capability. As the President mentioned, F-35A is a case in point. SM-3 Block IIA is another plan for purchase from the United States. Aegis vessels -- the quality and the quantity must be enhanced. In that process, we will be buying more from the United States. That is what I\'m thinking.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tNow, North Korea: North Korea launched missiles. Immediately after that, we traced them; we were able to grasp and trace where they were going. Missile defense is something which is based upon the cooperation between Japan and the United States. Missile defense system is a cooperation between the two countries for the intercepting and shooting down. If it is necessary, of course, we will do that -- if it is necessary. But in doing so, U.S. and Japan will closely coordinate our actions. Thank you.</p>\\n<p>\\n\\tThank you very much. With this, we will end the joint press conference by the two leaders of Japan and the United States. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen of the press.</p>\\n<p class="rtecenter">\\n\\tEND</p>\\n<p class="rteright">\\n\\t3:35 P.M. JST</p>\\n<p>\\n\\t\\xa0</p>\\n</div>\\n</div>]'}}
